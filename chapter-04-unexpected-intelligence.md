# Chapter 4: Unexpected Intelligence

I should have walked away.

The supplies were gathered, my late meeting was getting later by the second, and I'd already spent far too long talking to Lucas Wade on a public street corner where anyone could see us.

But I didn't move.

Neither did he.

We stood there in the warm June sunshine, Fourth of July decorations piled between us like a patriotic barrier that was somehow also a bridge. Lucas had his hands in his pockets, head tilted slightly as he looked at me with those dark, perceptive eyes.

"So," he said finally. "Planning the whole Fourth of July celebration yourself. That's got to be overwhelming."

It wasn't really a question, more an observation. But something in his tone made me answer honestly instead of deflecting with my practiced response.

"It's a lot," I admitted, adjusting my grip on the bunting. "Parade permits, vendor contracts, stage setup, fireworks coordination, volunteer scheduling, safety inspections. Plus making sure everything looks perfect for the campaign photographers."

"Because it's not really about the town celebrating Independence Day. It's about your father looking good for voters."

The blunt assessment should have made me defensive. Instead, I felt that same loosening in my chest—the relief of someone seeing through the performance.

"Both, I guess. He wants it to be a good celebration. But yes, it's also his big campaign showcase before the August election."

"Must be exhausting," Lucas said. "Planning a whole event while making sure you don't accidentally ruin your father's political career by, I don't know, hanging the bunting wrong."

I laughed despite myself. "You joke, but my mother literally gave me instructions about bunting arrangement. Red, white, and blue in that order, evenly spaced, no sagging."

"Of course she did." Lucas's mouth quirked. "Can't have rebellious bunting undermining family values."

"The bunting reflects our commitment to tradition and proper standards."

"You sound just like a campaign speech."

"I've heard enough of them." The words came out more bitter than I intended. I caught myself, adding quickly, "I mean—"

"You don't have to do that," Lucas interrupted gently. "The thing where you say something real and then backtrack to make it proper. I'm not going to run to the newspaper that the mayor's daughter has actual opinions."

I looked at him, startled. "How do you know I do that?"

"Because I've watched you at campaign events. You've got two modes—performed and actually human. Right now you're switching between them every thirty seconds." He shifted the poster board he was still holding. "For what it's worth, I like the actually human version better."

Heat crept up my neck. Not embarrassment exactly, but something more complicated. Being seen felt dangerous and thrilling at the same time.

"The actually human version doesn't really fit the mayor's daughter job description," I said.

"Maybe the job description is the problem."

Before I could process that, Lucas glanced down at the book tucked into his jacket pocket. Only the spine was visible, but I could make out partial lettering.

"Is that Camus?" I asked before I could think better of it.

Lucas looked surprised. "You know Camus?"

"'The Stranger.' We read it in English class last semester." I gestured toward the book. "That's the same one, isn't it?"

"Yeah." Lucas pulled it out, showing me the worn paperback. "You actually read it? Or just skimmed the Cliff Notes?"

"I read it. Twice, actually. Mrs. Thompson assigned it, but I wanted to understand it better, so I read it again during summer break."

Now Lucas was looking at me like I'd said something completely unexpected. "The mayor's perfect daughter reads French existentialism for fun?"

"Is that so surprising?"

"Kind of, yeah. I figured you spent your summers at country club pools learning to make polite conversation."

"I do that too," I admitted. "But I also read. When I can find the time between campaign events and Fourth of July planning and proper behavior lessons."

Lucas studied me with what looked like genuine interest. "So what did you think? About the book?"

"Honestly?"

"Always."

The simple certainty in his voice made something in me relax.

"I thought Meursault was alienated from society because he refused to perform the emotions people expected," I said. "Everyone wanted him to cry at his mother's funeral, to show remorse at his trial, to pretend he felt things he didn't actually feel. And his honesty made him dangerous to them."

Lucas's eyes had gone sharp with attention. "Go on."

"It's about the cost of authenticity in a world that demands performance." The words came faster now, ideas I'd turned over in my head but never spoken aloud. "Meursault wouldn't play the game, wouldn't pretend, wouldn't give them the emotional theater they wanted. So they killed him for it."

"Heavy takeaway for a sixteen-year-old."

"I'm almost seventeen," I said automatically, then realized how defensive that sounded. "Sorry. That's—"

"True?" Lucas smiled. "And your reading is dead-on, by the way. Most people think it's about moral indifference. They miss the whole point about society demanding emotional performance."

"You've thought about this a lot."

"I've got time to think. Not a lot of people want to have actual conversations with the town troublemaker." He said it matter-of-factly, without self-pity. "So I read instead."

"What else are you reading?"

Lucas looked at me like he was trying to figure out if I was genuinely interested or just being polite. Whatever he saw in my expression must have convinced him, because he answered.

"Kerouac. 'On the Road.' Just came out this year."

"I've heard of it. The Beat Generation stuff?"

"Yeah. It's about breaking free from expectations and finding yourself through movement and experience. About refusing to settle for the safe, conventional life everyone says you should want."

The way he said it made me wonder if he was talking about the book or about himself.

"That sounds..." I searched for the right word. "Dangerous."

"Or necessary." Lucas met my eyes. "Depends on how trapped you feel in your current life."

The air between us felt suddenly charged, like we weren't talking about literature anymore.

"I should really get to my meeting," I said, even though I didn't want to leave. "I'm incredibly late at this point."

"Right. Can't keep the planning committee waiting." Lucas handed me the poster board. "Wouldn't want anyone thinking the mayor's daughter is irresponsible."

There was no mockery in his voice, just a kind of gentle understanding that hurt more than teasing would have.

"Lucas," I said impulsively. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"Why did you help me? With the supplies, I mean. You could have just walked past, let me deal with my own mess."

He considered the question seriously. "Because you looked like you needed help. And because..." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "Because for about three seconds after you crashed into me, before you realized who I was, you looked real. Not performed. Just real. And I don't see that much in Liberty Beach."

"You don't see what much?"

"Real people. Everyone here is so busy being who they're supposed to be—respectable or proper or whatever—that they forget how to just be. But you, for those three seconds, you were just a girl who'd collided with someone and dropped her stuff. You weren't the mayor's daughter yet. You were just Kate."

My throat felt tight. "I don't know how to be just Kate."

"Yeah." Lucas's voice was soft. "I know."

We stood there, and I realized this was the longest real conversation I'd had with anyone in months. Maybe longer. Jen came close, but even with her I censored myself, performed a slightly softer version of perfect Kate. With David I was all performance, no substance. With my parents I was a campaign asset who occasionally ate dinner.

But with Lucas, standing on a sidewalk corner surrounded by Fourth of July decorations, I was having an actual conversation about Camus and authenticity and the exhausting weight of constant performance.

It was terrifying.

It was also the best I'd felt in years.

"I really do need to go," I said reluctantly. "The committee is probably sending a search party."

"Probably." Lucas stepped back, giving me space to leave. "Good luck with the planning. And with the bunting arrangement. Red, white, and blue in that order. No sagging."

I laughed. "I'll do my best."

"Hey, Kate?"

I turned back.

"If you ever want to talk about books—or Anything else—I'm usually at my dad's garage in the afternoons. Wade's Garage, down by the docks." He shrugged, trying for casual but not quite pulling it off. "You know, if you need a break from being perfect."

My heart did something complicated in my chest.

"I'll remember that," I managed.

"Cool." Lucas pulled his jacket collar up despite the heat and walked away, heading toward the docks with his hands back in his pockets.

I watched him go, then turned toward the community center, supplies carefully balanced, mind spinning.

Lucas Wade read Camus and Kerouac.

Lucas Wade saw through my performance to something real underneath.

Lucas Wade had just invited me to talk to him again.

And I wanted to. That was the dangerous part. I actually wanted to go to Wade's Garage and talk about books and authenticity and all the things I couldn't say to anyone else.

I couldn't, of course. The mayor's daughter didn't hang around mechanics' garages talking to troublemakers about French existentialism. That would cause exactly the kind of scandal Father's campaign couldn't afford.

But as I hurried toward my very late planning committee meeting, I couldn't stop thinking about dark eyes and honest conversation.

About someone who saw past the performance to the person underneath.

About how good it felt to be seen.

The committee meeting was going to be a disaster—I was twenty minutes late with bunting I couldn't explain falling apart and red paint smudged on my blouse. Mother would have opinions. Father would be disappointed.

But for twenty minutes on Main Street, I'd been real.

And I was starting to think that might be worth whatever trouble came next.

Even if it shouldn't be.

Even if I knew better.

Even if everything I'd been taught said this was dangerous and wrong and politically catastrophic.

For twenty minutes, I'd felt alive instead of performed.

And now that I knew what that felt like, I wasn't sure I could go back to forgetting.

The community center doors loomed ahead. I took a deep breath, smoothed my hair, checked my smile in the glass.

Time to be the mayor's daughter again.

But somewhere inside, just Kate was still thinking about Camus.

And Lucas.

And the possibility that maybe, just maybe, authenticity was worth the risk.
