# Chapter 6: Regret and Recognition

I couldn't stop seeing it.

That night, lying in my bed with moonlight painting silver squares on my bedroom floor, I replayed the scene over and over. Lucas's face when my father made that comment about wasting potential. The careful blankness in his eyes when my mother dismissed him. The resigned set of his shoulders as he walked away.

The way he'd looked at me for just one second before leaving, like he'd been hoping I might surprise him.

And my silence. My damning, cowardly silence.

I rolled over, punching my pillow into a different shape like that would help me sleep. It didn't.

The worst part was knowing Lucas had expected it. He hadn't looked surprised or hurt. Just resigned. Like of course the mayor's daughter would choose her family's expectations over defending him. Like he'd seen it coming from a mile away.

Because people like me always chose safety over honesty.

People like me always performed.

I stared at my ceiling and admitted something I'd been avoiding for weeks, maybe months, maybe years.

I was miserable.

The perfect life everyone envied—the beautiful Victorian house on Beach Hill, the attentive parents, the appropriate boyfriend, the college plans, the leadership positions, the campaign events—it was all performance. A carefully constructed facade with nothing real underneath.

Or maybe there had been something real once, and I'd performed it into extinction.

I'd been so good at being perfect that I'd forgotten how to be anything else.

The next morning at breakfast, Mother commented that I looked tired. Father asked if I was feeling all right. I smiled and said I was fine, just stayed up too late working on Fourth of July planning.

They believed me because I'd given them the answer they wanted.

Because that's what I always did.

Over the next few days, I found myself looking for Lucas.

I didn't plan it. Didn't consciously decide to search for him. But somehow my errands always took me past the docks. My route to the library happened to go by Wade's Garage. When I walked to Harper's Drugstore, I found myself scanning the streets, looking for a leather jacket and dark hair.

Tuesday afternoon, I spotted him outside Miller's General Store, talking to Mr. Miller about something mechanical—probably the delivery truck that was always breaking down. I stood frozen half a block away, watching him gesture with his hands, explaining something. Even from a distance, I could see his intelligence in the way he communicated.

Walk over there, I told myself. Apologize. Explain that you wanted to defend him but couldn't find the words.

But my feet wouldn't move.

Because what would I say? Sorry my parents were awful to you, but I couldn't speak up because my father's campaign matters more than basic human decency?

Lucas finished his conversation and walked away toward the docks. I stayed where I was, hating myself.

Wednesday, I saw him riding his motorcycle down Main Street—a beautiful machine he'd apparently built himself from scrap parts. The engine sound was different from other motorcycles, somehow smoother. He wore his leather jacket despite the summer heat, dark hair caught in the wind.

He didn't see me standing outside the community center with Fourth of July planning documents.

I watched until he disappeared around the corner.

Thursday, he was at the library. I'd gone to research parade permit regulations, and there he was in the back corner, surrounded by books. Philosophy, by the look of the spines. He was completely absorbed, making notes in a worn notebook.

I stood in the stacks watching him for five full minutes before fleeing to the reference section like a coward.

I had no idea what I was doing. No idea what I wanted. I just knew that something had shifted inside me during those thirty seconds of conversation on Main Street. Lucas had seen me—really seen me—and now I couldn't stop thinking about that moment of recognition.

About being seen as Kate instead of as Katherine Morrison, campaign asset.

About honesty instead of performance.

About what it might feel like to be real.

Friday afternoon, I sat at a planning committee meeting only half-listening to Mrs. Henderson's opinions about proper flag etiquette. Jen had been watching me with increasingly worried eyes all week.

After the meeting, she cornered me outside.

"Okay, seriously. What's going on with you?" Jen's normally sunny expression was clouded with concern. "You've been acting weird since last Saturday. You're distracted, you look like you haven't slept, and you keep staring off into space during meetings."

"I'm fine. Just stressed about the celebration."

"Kate." Jen crossed her arms. "It's me. I know when you're lying."

I wanted to tell her. Wanted to explain about Lucas and the conversation and my parents' cruelty and my own silence. Wanted to admit that I couldn't stop thinking about dark eyes and honest words.

But the explanation stuck in my throat.

Because telling Jen meant acknowledging I cared. Meant admitting the mayor's daughter was thinking about the town troublemaker. Meant crossing a line I'd been taught never to approach.

"I'm just tired," I said finally. "This celebration is a lot of work."

Jen studied my face, clearly not buying it. "Is this about David? Did something happen with him?"

"No. David's fine. Everything's fine."

"Then what?"

"Nothing. Really, Jen. I'm just overwhelmed." I forced a smile—the practiced one that came so easily. "I'll be better once we get past the Fourth."

Jen looked like she wanted to argue, but she knew when to back off. "Okay. But Kate? If you need to talk, about anything, I'm here. You know that, right?"

"I know. Thank you."

She squeezed my hand and left for her date with Tommy.

I stood alone outside the community center, watching Liberty Beach carry on with its perfectly normal summer evening. Families walking to McCarthy's Diner for supper. Couples strolling toward the beach. Mr. Miller sweeping the sidewalk outside his store.

Everything wholesome and proper and exactly as it should be.

Everything except me.

Saturday morning, David picked me up for the sock hop we'd agreed to attend. He looked exactly as expected—pressed slacks, fresh haircut, eager smile. He complimented my pink dress. I thanked him. We made polite conversation in his father's Chevrolet all the way to the community center.

The sock hop was packed with Liberty Beach teenagers celebrating summer. The decorations committee had hung streamers and balloons. A local DJ spun records—Pat Boone and Patti Page and other appropriately wholesome music. Chaperones lined the walls, making sure everyone behaved properly.

David and I danced the acceptable distance apart. He told me about his summer job at his father's bank. I told him about Fourth of July planning. We smiled and swayed and looked like the perfect young couple.

I felt nothing.

Not attraction. Not connection. Not even mild interest.

Just the familiar emptiness of another performance.

"You seem distracted," David said during a slow song. "Everything okay?"

"Just thinking about the celebration."

"You work too hard." He smiled his pleasant, predictable smile. "You should relax more. Enjoy summer."

"You're probably right."

"After the Fourth is over, maybe we could go to the beach more. Or catch a movie. Spend more time together."

He meant it as sweet. As relationship-building. As courtship.

All I could think was: More time performing. More empty conversations. More pretending to be interested in someone I felt nothing for.

"That sounds nice," I heard myself say.

Because that's what the mayor's daughter did. Said nice things. Agreed to appropriate dates. Maintained the facade.

David beamed, taking my agreement as enthusiasm instead of the hollow response it was.

Across the dance floor, I caught Jen's eye. She was dancing with Tommy, laughing at something he'd said. Tommy was stepping on her feet—boy couldn't dance to save his life—but Jen looked genuinely happy.

She had what I was pretending to have.

Real connection. Real affection. Real interest in the person holding her.

I was so envious I could barely breathe.

When David drove me home later, he walked me to my door like a gentleman. He asked if he could see me again soon. I said yes. He looked pleased.

"You're really something, Kate," he said, squeezing my hand. "I'm lucky to be dating you."

The words should have made me happy. Should have been flattering.

Instead, they made me want to scream.

Because David thought he was dating Kate Morrison. But Kate Morrison was a performance. A carefully constructed character designed to please everyone and reveal nothing.

The real Kate—whoever she was—had been buried so deep I wasn't sure she existed anymore.

Except for thirty seconds on Main Street with Lucas Wade, when I'd felt her stirring. When I'd laughed genuinely and spoken honestly and been seen instead of just looked at.

"Goodnight, David," I said.

"Goodnight, Kate. Sweet dreams."

I watched him drive away, then went inside to my perfect house with my perfect room and my perfectly performing parents.

I lay in bed staring at my ceiling again.

Sweet dreams, David had said.

But my dreams weren't sweet lately. They were confused and frustrating and full of dark eyes and resigned expressions and the knowledge that I'd failed some test I didn't even know I was taking.

I'd become exactly what I'd always been taught to be: the perfect mayor's daughter.

And somewhere along the way, I'd lost track of whether there was anything else inside me.

Lucas had seen it though. In those thirty seconds before I'd shut down and performed perfect Kate, he'd seen something real.

And now I couldn't stop wondering if that something real could still be found.

If maybe, buried underneath sixteen years of political smiles and proper behavior, there was still an authentic Kate Morrison waiting to be discovered.

The thought terrified me.

It also wouldn't leave me alone.

In the darkness of my perfect bedroom, I made a decision.

I would find Lucas. I would apologize for my silence. I would thank him for helping me.

I would be honest, just for one conversation, and see what happened.

It was reckless. It was dangerous to the campaign. It was everything I'd been taught not to do.

But I couldn't keep living like this—performed and hollow and empty.

Something had to change.

Even if I had no idea what that change would look like.

Even if it scared me half to death.

I fell asleep planning what I might say when I finally found the courage to cross the invisible line Liberty Beach had drawn between the mayor's daughter and the town troublemaker.

And for the first time in days, my dreams felt less like performances and more like possibilities.
