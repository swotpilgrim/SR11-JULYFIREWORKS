# Chapter 15: Campaign Ammunition

The first flyer appeared Tuesday morning.

Bright yellow, stapled to a telephone pole on Main Street. Bold black letters: "CAN MAYOR MORRISON LEAD LIBERTY BEACH IF HE CAN'T LEAD HIS OWN FAMILY?"

My stomach dropped.

I tore it down, crumpling it. But there were more. On the next pole. On storefronts. On car windshields.

Robert Caldwell's campaign had found their ammunition.

And that ammunition was me.

---

The flyer didn't mention me by name. It didn't have to.

"Mayor Morrison claims to represent family values. But can we trust a man whose own daughter makes questionable choices?"

Questionable choices. Two words encompassing everything.

I walked faster, clutching my planning folder.

At the corner, Mrs. Henderson appeared.

"Katherine, dear. I saw those awful flyers. Absolutely disgraceful."

She didn't look like she thought it was disgraceful.

"It's campaign season. These things happen."

"Still. Must be difficult." Mrs. Henderson leaned in. "Teenagers make mistakes. But you're young. You'll recover."

Recover. Like I'd had a cold instead of feelings.

"I need to get to a meeting."

"Of course. Oh, Katherine? You're still sitting with David at the Fourth of July celebration? It would be good for people to see you two together."

Fix the mess by performing perfect couple again.

"We'll see."

Behind me, her stage whisper: "Poor thing. Absolutely mortified."

---

The community center buzzed with tension.

Father's campaign team had assembled—Mr. Thompson, Mr. Hartwell, Mrs. Henderson, three other donors, and Father's campaign manager, George Sullivan.

And me. Sitting in the corner like a problem.

"Thank you for coming," Father began. He looked exhausted. "I assume you've seen Caldwell's attack."

Grim nods.

"It's effective," George Sullivan said bluntly. A political operative from Richmond. "Playing to traditional values. The question about leading your family hits hard."

"It's not fair," Mr. Thompson protested. "Richard is an excellent father. Katherine is a good girl who made one mistake."

I flinched at "good girl." Like a misbehaving dog.

"Fair doesn't matter," George said. "Perception matters. And the perception right now is that the mayor's daughter has been sneaking around with exactly the kind of young man the mayor's policies claim to rehabilitate."

"I wasn't sneaking—" I started.

George looked at me like I'd just confirmed his worst fears. "Katherine, with respect, whether you call it sneaking or not doesn't matter. What matters is what voters think. And they think the mayor can't manage his own household."

"That's absurd," I said. "My personal life has nothing to do with Father's qualifications."

"You're naive if you believe that." George pulled out a stack of papers. "I've been polling since the story broke. Morrison's favorable numbers dropped four points. Four points in two days. That's significant in a tight race."

Father's face was pale. "Four points?"

"Yes. And Caldwell is up three. The gap is closing."

Silence fell over the room.

"What's our response strategy?" Mr. Hartwell asked finally.

George flipped through his notes. "Several recommendations. First, Katherine needs to make a public appearance with David Hartwell. Soon. Tomorrow if possible. Somewhere visible—the diner, the drugstore, somewhere the whole town will see them together."

"I can make that happen," Mr. Hartwell said. "David's willing."

Of course David was willing. David was always willing to play his assigned role.

"Second," George continued, "Katherine should issue a statement. Nothing elaborate. Just a simple acknowledgment that she made a poor judgment call in associating with Lucas Wade, that she's learned from the experience, and that she's focused on helping her father's campaign through appropriate volunteer work."

"An apology," I said flatly.

"A clarification," George corrected. "Voters want to know you recognize the mistake."

"It wasn't a mistake."

The room went silent. All eyes turned to me.

"Katherine," Father said warningly.

"It wasn't," I repeated, my voice shaking but determined. "Talking to someone isn't a crime. Having a conversation isn't a scandal. The only mistake was getting seen doing something that Liberty Beach's social hierarchy doesn't approve of."

"That's exactly the kind of attitude that's costing your father this election," George said coldly. "Whether you like it or not, you're part of a political family. Your actions have consequences beyond your personal feelings."

"I understand that—"

"Do you? Because from where I'm sitting, you care more about defending some inappropriate relationship than about your father's career."

The accusation stung because it wasn't entirely wrong.

Mrs. Henderson jumped in. "Perhaps if Katherine spent more time with appropriate young people, this wouldn't have happened. David Hartwell is a lovely boy. And there are other suitable options—"

"I don't need you to matchmake for me," I snapped.

"Katherine!" Mother's voice was sharp. She'd been silent until now, sitting next to Father with her perfect posture and perfect pearls. "Apologize to Mrs. Henderson."

I bit my tongue. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Henderson."

"It's quite all right, dear. You're under a lot of stress." Mrs. Henderson's smile was poison-sweet. "We all understand."

George shuffled his papers. "Third recommendation: the Fourth of July celebration needs to be picture-perfect. Katherine chairs the planning committee, which could work in our favor if executed correctly. Morrison's daughter organizing a successful community event shows family investment in Liberty Beach. But—" he looked at me directly, "—that means no more scandals. No controversial associations. Nothing that gives Caldwell more ammunition."

"I'm not associating with Lucas," I said. Not exactly a lie—I'd promised my parents I wouldn't see him, even if I hadn't decided whether to keep that promise.

"Good. Keep it that way." George made a note. "Fourth: We need surrogate voices. People defending the Morrison family's values. Mrs. Henderson, could you organize your bridge group to write letters to the editor?"

"Of course. We'll emphasize Richard's dedication to family and community."

"Excellent. Mr. Thompson, can you work the Rotary Club?"

"Already on it."

They discussed strategy for another hour—where Father should make speeches, which donors to court, how to counter Caldwell's attacks. I sat in the corner, my presence required but my voice unwelcome.

Occasionally someone glanced at me—the problem child who'd created this mess.

Finally, George wrapped up. "Bottom line: We have six weeks until the election. Caldwell's gaining ground, but this is recoverable. If Katherine maintains appropriate behavior, if the Fourth of July celebration goes well, if we can shift the narrative back to Morrison's record instead of his family drama—we can win this."

If Katherine behaves. If Katherine performs. If Katherine stops being a problem.

I was so tired of being a problem.

After the meeting, Father pulled me aside.

"This is serious, Katherine. Did you hear those poll numbers?"

"I heard."

"Four points. Because of you. Because of your choices."

The guilt was crushing. "I didn't mean—"

"Intent doesn't matter. Results matter." He rubbed his face wearily. "George is right. We need damage control. Can you do this? The appearance with David tomorrow? The focus on Fourth of July planning? The appropriate behavior through the election?"

I looked at my father—this man who'd raised me, provided for me, worked himself exhausted trying to lead this town. Who loved me in his way, even if that way came wrapped in political calculation.

"Yes," I heard myself say. "I can do that."

"Thank you." Relief flooded his expression. "I know this is hard, Katie-girl. But after the election, things will calm down. You'll see."

He actually believed that. Believed that once he won in August, everything would go back to normal. That I'd forget Lucas and marry David and become exactly the daughter he'd always wanted.

He had no idea that normal was the problem.

That I'd rather lose everything than go back to performing forever.

That the person I was becoming couldn't fit into the role he'd designed.

But I smiled and nodded, because that's what campaign daughters did.

That afternoon, David picked me up for our very public appearance at McCarthy's Diner.

"Thanks for doing this," I said as we walked down Main Street, every eye watching.

"No problem. My dad explained the situation." David took my hand—a gesture he'd never made before. For the cameras, for the watchers, for the performance.

I let him.

At the diner, we sat in the front window booth—maximum visibility. Ordered milkshakes we didn't want. Smiled at each other across the table.

"You okay?" David asked quietly. "This has to be weird for you."

"It's a nightmare."

"I'm sorry. For what it's worth, I don't think you did anything wrong. Talking to someone isn't a crime."

The unexpected kindness caught me off-guard. "Thank you."

"I mean, Lucas Wade isn't who I'd choose for you to hang out with. But you're not a bad person for talking to him."

Not a ringing endorsement, but more understanding than anyone else had offered.

"Can I ask you something?" David leaned forward. "Do you actually have feelings for him? Real feelings?"

I could lie. Should lie. This was David—pleasant, appropriate, politically convenient David.

But I was so tired of lying.

"Yes," I said quietly. "I do."

David sat back, processing this. "Huh."

"I'm sorry. I know our fathers arranged—"

"Kate, we're not actually dating. We're performing dating because it's politically useful." He said it without rancor, just stating facts. "I like you fine. You're smart and pretty and nice. But I'm not in love with you. And you're clearly not in love with me."

"No. I'm not."

"So really, this is just good theater for the campaign."

"I guess it is."

We sat in awkward honesty for a moment.

"For the record," David said finally, "after your dad's election is over, you should do what makes you happy. Even if that's Lucas Wade."

"Really?"

"Yeah. Life's too short to date someone because your parents told you to." He grinned. "Even if that someone is me."

I laughed—actual, genuine laughter. "You're a good guy, David."

"I know. Tell your friends." He raised his milkshake. "To political theater."

I clinked my glass against his. "To surviving campaign season."

We finished our performance—milkshakes, smiles, hand-holding as we left. The whole town saw exactly what they needed to see.

But as David drove me home, I thought about his words: do what makes you happy.

Did I know what that was anymore?

Yes, a quiet voice inside me answered. You do.

You're just afraid to reach for it.

And in six weeks, when the election was over and I had to choose between the life everyone expected and the life I actually wanted—

I'd have to find the courage to be honest.

Not just with Lucas.

But with myself.

The question was: could I?

I didn't know.

But sitting in David's car, watching Liberty Beach roll past, I knew one thing for certain:

I couldn't keep living like this.

Something had to change.

And that change was coming.

Whether I was ready or not.
