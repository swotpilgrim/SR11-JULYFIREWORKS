# Chapter 21: The Agreement

That evening, I stood in front of my mirror for the second time in as many days, transformed once again into the mayor's perfect daughter.

The pink dress. The pearls. The blue cardigan. Grandmother's bracelet. Hair in perfect victory rolls. Mary Jane shoes polished to gleaming.

I looked exactly like I was supposed to look. Like I'd looked last night, and would look tomorrow, and every day after for the rest of my perfectly planned life.

"Absolutely beautiful," Mother said from the doorway. "Just perfect."

I managed a smile. The performance had begun.

David arrived precisely at seven-thirty, holding the same corsage from last night—pink roses to match my dress. We'd done this before. We'd do it again. The routine was already established.

"Ready for round two?" he asked with a pleasant smile.

Round two. As if this were a game instead of my life.

"Ready," I lied.

The drive to the Liberty Beach Community Center was déjà vu. David made the same pleasant conversation. I made the same appropriate responses. We were becoming experts at our roles.

But this time, the photographer wasn't the only one waiting. Half the town seemed to have turned out for the dance, drawn by yesterday's front-page photograph promising a sequel. Everyone wanted to see the mayor's daughter with the approved boyfriend, proof that the scandal was truly over.

David offered his arm. I took it. Flash bulbs popped.

We walked into the community center to a sea of familiar faces. Campaign volunteers, committee members, classmates, parents. All watching, judging, measuring my performance against their expectations.

The band was playing something upbeat and patriotic. Red, white, and blue streamers decorated every surface. A painted banner proclaimed "Liberty Beach Celebrates Freedom!" The irony of that word—freedom—while I stood trapped in this performance wasn't lost on me.

"Kate! David!" Jen bounced over with Tommy in tow. "You both look so keen! Let's dance!"

The four of us moved onto the dance floor. The music was loud enough that conversation was difficult, which suited me fine. I swayed and smiled and let David spin me occasionally, the perfect picture of a girl having a perfectly good time at a perfectly appropriate dance.

Mrs. Henderson appeared with the newspaper photographer. "One more for tomorrow's edition?" She positioned David and me near the refreshment table, adjusting our poses like we were mannequins. "Big smiles! Show everyone how happy you are!"

I smiled. David smiled. The flash went off.

"Perfect!" Mrs. Henderson beamed. "This will run alongside the Fourth of July celebration preview. Great publicity for the campaign."

Of course. It was always about the campaign.

David and I danced three more songs. He was a good dancer—lessons, probably, just like me. Everything about us had been carefully cultivated. Good manners, good posture, good breeding. We were the product of expensive effort to create appropriately socialized young people.

We had absolutely nothing genuine between us.

"You seem distracted," David observed during a slow song. "Everything okay?"

"Just tired," I said. "Long day of planning meetings."

"The Fourth celebration is going to be spectacular," he said. "My father says your organization has been exceptional. Very impressive."

Impressive. Organized. Appropriate. The words that defined my existence.

"Thank you," I said automatically.

David pulled me slightly closer, testing boundaries. I let him, because that's what I was supposed to do. Show affection for the approved boyfriend. Demonstrate that the summer mistake was forgotten.

His arms around me felt like nothing. No spark, no recognition, no authenticity. Just pleasant pressure from a pleasant boy in a pleasant dance at a pleasant event.

I thought about Lucas's arms around me at the old pier. The way it had felt like coming home and setting sail at the same time. Safe and exciting. Real.

I pushed the thought away. That was over. Lucas had released me. Made the noble sacrifice. We'd both agreed this was impossible.

Even if the agreement felt like surrender.

The evening progressed. More dancing, more photographs, more performing. Father appeared briefly with Mother, working the crowd, shaking hands, thanking volunteers. When he saw me with David, he nodded approvingly.

Mission accomplished. Daughter back under control. Campaign saved.

Around nine o'clock, we took a break from dancing. David brought me punch while I stood with Jen near the refreshment table.

"You and David are so cute together," Jen gushed. "Much better than—well, you know. This is how it should be. You look so happy!"

Did I? I felt hollow. But apparently I performed happiness convincingly enough to fool my best friend.

Tommy joined us, and the three of them discussed plans for after the Fourth of July celebration. Beach bonfire, maybe a late movie at the drive-in. The summer stretching ahead, full of appropriately wholesome activities with appropriately approved friends.

The life I'd have chosen, if I'd never met Lucas. If I'd never discovered what authenticity felt like.

David returned with my punch. "Having fun?"

"Yes," I said. The lie came easily now. I'd been practicing my whole life.

At nine-thirty—the exact minimum time Mr. Henderson had specified—I suggested we should probably leave. David agreed readily. We said our goodbyes, thanked the chaperones, and walked out to his car amid knowing smiles from the adults.

The mayor's daughter, leaving appropriately early with her appropriate boyfriend. Everything by the book.

In the car, David talked about the dance, about how successful it had been, about how his mother would be pleased with the photographs. I made appropriate responses, my autopilot fully engaged.

He drove me home and walked me to the door like a gentleman. "I had a really nice time, Kate. Again."

"Me too."

He leaned in like he might kiss me. I turned my head slightly so he caught my cheek instead. "My parents are probably watching from the window," I murmured, as if that were the only reason I'd redirected him.

"Of course." David stepped back, understanding. Always understanding, always appropriate. "I'll see you at the Fourth celebration?"

"I'll be the one onstage with my father," I said with attempted lightness.

"I'll wave from the crowd." He squeezed my hand. "Goodnight, Kate."

"Goodnight, David."

I watched him drive away, then went inside to face my parents' approval.

They were indeed waiting in the living room, Father with his evening paper, Mother with her needlepoint. The picture of domestic contentment.

"How was the dance, sweetheart?" Mother asked.

"Fine. Nice. The decorations were very patriotic."

"And David?" Father looked up from his paper.

"Perfect gentleman, as always."

Father smiled. Actually smiled. "I'm proud of you, Kate. I know these past few days have been difficult. But you've handled yourself with grace and maturity. The campaign is recovering beautifully, thanks in large part to you."

Thanks to my performance, he meant. Thanks to my willingness to sublimate my authentic self for his political ambitions.

"I'm just glad things are back to normal," I said, because that's what they wanted to hear.

"They are," Mother agreed, setting aside her needlepoint. "And tomorrow will be the capstone. You'll stand with your father during his speech, looking beautiful and supportive. The family united. It will be perfect."

There was that word again. Perfect.

I excused myself and went upstairs to my room. I carefully removed the dress, the pearls, the cardigan. Unpinned my hair and washed my face. Removed every trace of the performance until I was just Kate Morrison in pajamas, staring at herself in the mirror.

Except I didn't know who Kate Morrison was anymore. Not really.

Was I the girl who laughed at the old pier? Or the girl who smiled for newspaper cameras? Was I authentic rebellion or practiced performance? Was I making the mature choice or the cowardly one?

I didn't know. I genuinely didn't know.

What I did know was that tomorrow I'd stand on that stage with Father. Tomorrow I'd smile for hundreds of people and prove that the mayor's daughter had returned to her proper place. Tomorrow the performance would reach its climax, and I would play my role perfectly.

Just like I'd been trained to do.

I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. Two more days until the Fourth of July. Two more days until I officially confirmed my choice—family over authenticity, duty over desire, performance over reality.

Everyone seemed pleased with this outcome. Father, Mother, David, the campaign volunteers, the town gossips. Even Lucas thought this was the right choice. The noble thing. The mature thing.

Everyone was pleased except me.

But maybe my feelings didn't matter. Maybe they never had. Maybe I was always meant to be Kate Morrison, Mayor's Daughter, and that brief summer girl at the old pier was just a pleasant dream I'd mistaken for reality.

I rolled over and closed my eyes, willing sleep to come.

Tomorrow would be another performance. And the day after that. And the day after that.

Forever and ever, until I forgot what wasn't performance.

Until I forgot what it felt like to be real.
