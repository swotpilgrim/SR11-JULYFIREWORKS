# Chapter 14: Parental Fury

I didn't sleep.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Mrs. Miller's delighted expression. Heard Mother's cold fury. Imagined tomorrow's conversations at Miller's General Store, at Harper's Drugstore, at every coffee klatch and bridge game in Liberty Beach.

The mayor's daughter. That Wade boy. Seen together. At dusk. Near the old pier.

The gossip would be relentless.

Morning came too soon. I dressed carefully—modest blue dress, pearls, hair in perfect victory rolls. Armor for whatever came next.

Father was waiting at the breakfast table.

One look at his face told me everything. He'd been up all night too, probably fielding phone calls, strategizing with campaign advisors, calculating political damage.

"Sit down, Katherine."

Mother stood by the stove, her back rigid with tension. She didn't turn around.

I sat.

Father set down his coffee cup with deliberate control. "I've had four phone calls this morning. Before seven a.m. Four separate people felt the need to inform me that my daughter was seen with Lucas Wade yesterday evening."

His voice was quiet. That made it worse.

"Father, I can explain—"

"Can you?" He looked at me directly. "Can you explain why you were at the docks at dusk with the one person in Liberty Beach you should be avoiding? During campaign season? Two months before the election?"

"We were just talking."

"Where?"

Silence.

"Katherine, answer me. Where were you with that boy?"

"The old pier."

Father's face went white, then red. "The condemned pier? The one with posted danger signs? The one that's officially off-limits?"

"It's safe if you know which planks to avoid."

"That's what concerns you? The structural integrity?" His voice rose. "Katherine, do you have any comprehension of what you've done?"

"I talked to someone. That's all. We talked."

"You were seen, Katherine. Seen coming from a secluded location with a boy of questionable character at an inappropriate hour, looking disheveled and guilty. Do you understand what that implies?"

"Nothing inappropriate happened!"

"Perception is reality in politics!" Father slammed his hand on the table, rattling the coffee cups. Mother flinched. I'd never seen him this angry. "It doesn't matter what actually happened. It matters what people think happened. And right now, the entire town thinks my daughter is having some kind of liaison with the town troublemaker!"

"Lucas isn't a troublemaker. He's smart and kind and he reads philosophy and—"

"I don't care what he reads!" Father stood, looming over me. "He's Tom Wade's son. He has a reputation. He got suspended for fighting. Half the town thinks he's headed nowhere. And you—my daughter, during my re-election campaign—are sneaking around with him behind condemned buildings!"

"We weren't sneaking—"

"Then what were you doing?"

The truth stuck in my throat. How could I explain the pier, our conversations, the way Lucas saw me as Kate instead of as a campaign asset? How could I make Father understand that those stolen hours were the only time I felt real?

"We were talking," I said again. "About books. About life. About..." I trailed off.

"About what, Katherine?"

"About feeling trapped in roles we didn't choose."

Father stared at me. "Trapped?"

"Yes. Trapped. Performing constantly. Never being allowed to just be ourselves without everyone judging or watching or using us for their own purposes."

"That's absurd. You have a wonderful life—"

"I have a performed life!" The words burst out. "I have a life where every single thing I do is calculated for political advantage. Where my boyfriend was chosen by arrangement. Where my college and major are predetermined. Where I can't even choose what to eat for breakfast without considering how it reflects on your campaign!"

"Katherine—"

"I'm not Katherine! I'm Kate. Just Kate. And with Lucas, I get to be that. For a few hours a week, I don't have to smile perfectly or say the right things or worry about every action reflecting on your career. I get to be real."

Silence filled the kitchen.

Then Father spoke, his voice deadly quiet: "How long has this been going on?"

"A few weeks."

"A few weeks." He turned away, hands clenched. "You've been secretly meeting with Lucas Wade for weeks. Lying to your mother and me. Using Fourth of July planning as cover. Risking everything—my campaign, your reputation, our family's standing—for what? Teenage rebellion?"

"For honesty. For someone who sees me as a person instead of as a political prop."

"I see you as my daughter!"

"You see me as your campaign asset! When's the last time you asked what I actually wanted? What I thought or felt or dreamed about? You assign me tasks and I comply. You tell me who to date and I agree. You plan my future and I perform gratitude. But you never ask what Kate Morrison wants."

Father's face was a mask of shock and hurt. "That's not fair."

"Isn't it?"

Mother turned from the stove, her eyes glistening. "Katherine, how can you say these things? After everything we've given you—"

"I'm not ungrateful. I know I'm privileged. I know I have a good life. But it's not my life. It's the life you designed for the perfect mayor's daughter. And I don't know how to be her anymore."

"Because of him." Father's voice went cold. "Lucas Wade has put these ideas in your head. Made you question your family, your values—"

"No. I've been questioning for years. I just never had anyone I could be honest with about it. Lucas didn't create my doubts. He just gave me space to admit them."

Father was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Tell me the truth, Katherine. All of it. How did this start? What exactly has been happening?"

So I told them. Not everything—I kept the pier to myself, kept the depth of my feelings private—but enough. The collision with the supplies. The conversations about books. The way Lucas saw through my performance. The stolen meetings where I could be real.

I didn't mention holding hands. Didn't mention dreams of walking down Main Street together. Didn't mention the growing something between us that felt more significant than friendship.

But Father's eyes were sharp. He heard what I wasn't saying.

"Do you have feelings for this boy?"

My hesitation was answer enough.

"My God." Father sat down heavily. "This is worse than I thought. You're not just talking. You're..." He couldn't seem to finish.

"I care about him," I said quietly. "Yes."

"What about David?"

"I don't love David. I never have. We were put together for political convenience."

"David is a fine young man from a good family!"

"David is pleasant and empty and I feel nothing for him!"

The words echoed in the suddenly silent kitchen.

Mother spoke first, her voice shaking. "Katherine, listen to yourself. You're throwing away a perfectly suitable relationship with a respectable boy for some kind of romantic fantasy with someone who will drag you down."

"Lucas wouldn't drag me anywhere. He's brilliant and hardworking and the only person who's ever treated me like I matter as myself."

"He's using you," Father said flatly. "Can't you see that? The town troublemaker gets close to the mayor's daughter? That's revenge, Katherine. Or rebellion. Or—"

"Stop." I stood, shaking with anger. "You don't know him. You've decided who he is based on one fight when he was fourteen. Based on his family's social class. Based on your political prejudices. But you're wrong."

"I'm wrong?" Father's voice went dangerously quiet. "I'm wrong to protect my daughter from someone who could ruin her reputation? Wrong to care about our family's standing? Wrong to expect you to behave appropriately during a crucial campaign?"

"You're wrong about Lucas. And you're wrong about me. I'm not your campaign asset. I'm a person. With my own thoughts and feelings and choices."

"As long as you live in this house, your choices affect this family."

"Then maybe I shouldn't live in this house!"

The words hung in the air, shocking all of us.

Mother's hand flew to her mouth. Father's face went pale.

"You don't mean that," he said finally.

Did I? Standing there in our perfect kitchen in our perfect house on Beach Hill, facing my parents' combined fury and disappointment—did I mean it?

"I don't know what I mean anymore," I whispered. "I just know I can't keep being the person you want me to be. It's killing me."

Father looked at me like I was a stranger. "Robert Caldwell's campaign is going to crucify me with this. The mayor can't control his own daughter. The mayor's family values are a sham. The mayor's daughter prefers delinquents to decent boys."

"I'm sorry about your campaign. I truly am. But my life can't be about nothing but your career."

"Your life is part of this family! And this family depends on my career!"

We stared at each other across an unbridgeable divide.

Finally, Father spoke, each word precise and final: "You will end this relationship with Lucas Wade. Immediately. You will apologize to David Hartwell. You will focus entirely on Fourth of July preparations and appropriate behavior through the election. After Father wins—if he wins—we'll discuss your future. But for now, Lucas Wade does not exist in your world. Are we clear?"

"And if I refuse?"

"Then there will be consequences." Father's eyes were hard. "For you and for him. I can make life very difficult for the Wade family. Building inspectors, zoning issues, business licenses. Is that what you want?"

He was threatening Lucas's family to control me.

"You wouldn't."

"Try me, Katherine."

Mother stepped forward. "Please, darling. Just be reasonable. End this foolishness. Focus on the campaign. Everything can go back to normal."

But normal was suffocating. Normal was performing. Normal was being Katherine Morrison, perfect daughter, instead of Kate Morrison, real person.

And I'd tasted freedom. Known honesty. Felt what it was like to be seen.

I couldn't go back.

But I couldn't defy them either. Not without consequences that would hurt Lucas and his family.

I was trapped. Again. Still. Always.

"Fine," I heard myself say. "I won't see Lucas again."

The lie tasted like ashes.

Father nodded, satisfied. "Good. Now go to your room. Your mother and I need to discuss damage control."

I fled upstairs, my perfect performance cracking with every step.

In my room, I collapsed on my bed, dry-eyed and hollow.

I'd promised to end it.

But how could I give up the only thing that made me feel real?

And what kind of person did it make me, that I'd already decided to break my promise?
