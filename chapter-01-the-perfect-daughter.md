# Chapter 1: The Perfect Daughter

I stood before my bedroom mirror on the morning of June fifteenth, 1957, practicing my smile.

Not just any smile—the smile. The one that said I was gracious but not eager, friendly but not familiar, perfectly pleasant without revealing a single genuine thought. I'd been perfecting it since I was old enough to stand beside my father at campaign events, and by now it came as naturally as breathing. Almost.

The girl in the mirror looked back at me with flawless victory rolls pinned just so, modest pearl earrings catching the morning light, lips curved in that practiced expression of warm approval. She wore a blue dress with a Peter Pan collar—appropriate, feminine, nothing too flashy. The pearls at her throat had been my grandmother's. Everything about her screamed "mayor's daughter."

I barely recognized her.

"Katherine!" My mother's voice drifted up the stairs, perfectly modulated even at a distance. "Breakfast in five minutes, darling. Your father wants to review talking points before the event."

"Coming, Mother," I called back, checking my appearance one final time. No stray hairs. No wrinkles in the dress. Slip showing? No. Seams straight? Yes. I smoothed the skirt over my petticoat and reached for my white gloves.

The stranger in the mirror smoothed her skirt at the exact same moment.

I turned away before I could think about that too hard.

Downstairs, the Morrison household hummed with its usual Saturday morning efficiency. The front parlor had been converted into campaign headquarters weeks ago, and even from the hallway I could hear volunteers answering phones, the clicking of a typewriter, the rustle of pamphlets being stuffed into envelopes. My father's re-election campaign had taken over our home as thoroughly as it had taken over our lives.

In the kitchen, Mother stood at the stove in a tailored suit the color of champagne, her dark hair swept into a perfect French twist. She was sliding scrambled eggs onto plates with the same precision she brought to everything else. My father sat at the breakfast table, already dressed in his best summer suit, studying voter registration lists while he sipped his coffee.

"Good morning, sweetheart," he said, glancing up as I entered. His eyes did a quick assessment—dress, hair, posture—and I saw the small nod of approval. I'd passed inspection. "Sleep well?"

"Yes, Father." I took my usual seat and spread my napkin across my lap. "Thank you."

Mother set a plate before me—eggs, toast with the crusts cut off, three perfect strawberries arranged at the edge. She'd been serving me the exact same breakfast for sixteen years. I wondered if she even remembered I preferred my eggs over-easy instead of scrambled. I certainly hadn't mentioned it in recent memory.

"The breakfast at the country club begins at nine-thirty," Father said, setting down his lists. "Robert Caldwell will be there, of course. He's been working the donor circuit hard these past few weeks." His mouth tightened slightly. Robert Caldwell was his opponent in the August election, a newcomer with money and ambition. "We need to remind people why they've trusted me to lead Liberty Beach for the past eight years."

"Your infrastructure speech?" Mother asked, pouring him more coffee.

"Infrastructure, tourism revenue, the new pier construction." He ticked items off on his fingers. "I'll mention the Fourth of July celebration—Katherine's heading up the planning committee this year."

Both of them looked at me expectantly.

I swallowed a bite of toast I didn't taste. "I'm honored to help, Father."

"It's not just about helping," he said, leaning forward slightly. His campaign voice—warm, authoritative, persuasive—slipped into place as easily as my smile. "The Fourth of July celebration is Liberty Beach's signature event. Hundreds of families, tourists spending money in local businesses, newspaper coverage from surrounding counties. It's a showcase for everything we've built here." He paused. "And it happens exactly four weeks before the election."

The unspoken message landed as clearly as if he'd said it aloud: Don't mess this up.

"I understand," I said. "I've already scheduled the first planning committee meeting for Monday afternoon. We'll review vendors, finalize the parade route, coordinate with the fire department for safety—"

"Excellent." Father smiled, the genuine one he reserved for family, and patted my hand. "I knew I could count on you, Katie-girl."

Katie-girl. He hadn't called me that in years. The unexpected tenderness caught in my throat.

Mother refilled my water glass, though it was still half full. "You'll be sitting with David Hartwell this morning, won't you? His father mentioned they'd be at our table."

David. Of course.

"Yes, Mother."

"Such a nice young man." She said it the same way she'd say "such nice weather" or "such a nice casserole." A statement of fact requiring no response. "His father tells us he's been accepted to State College for the fall. Business degree. Very sensible."

I nodded, pushing eggs around my plate.

"You should be friendly," Mother continued, settling into her own chair with her coffee, "but not too friendly. You know how people talk." Her eyes met mine with the weight of years of similar warnings. "Especially during campaign season. Everything we do reflects on your father's leadership. One wrong impression, one moment of poor judgment, and people question everything."

"I understand, Mother."

She reached over and adjusted my collar, though it didn't need adjusting. "I know you do, darling. You've always been such a good girl."

A good girl. The perfect daughter. The mayor's pristine representative of family values and small-town virtue.

I looked down at my plate and wondered when I'd last done anything that wasn't good. Not rebellious, not scandalous—just something that was mine, something I'd chosen simply because I wanted to. I couldn't remember.

"Katherine?" Father's voice pulled me back. "Are you listening?"

"Sorry. Yes. I'm listening."

He studied me for a moment, concern flickering across his face. "You seem distracted lately. Everything all right?"

"Just tired," I said, summoning the smile again. It slid into place perfectly, like a mask I'd worn so long it had melted into my skin. "Busy with finals last week, and now the Fourth of July planning. But I'm fine. Really."

The concern faded, replaced by satisfied approval. Of course I was fine. I was always fine.

"That's my girl." He returned to his lists. "Now, about this morning. The Hendersons will be there—major donors—and Margaret Henderson has been asking about you. She wants to know about your college plans."

My college plans. Another thing being decided around me rather than by me.

"I'll tell her I'm considering State College," I said dutifully. "English or education degree."

"Perfect." Mother smiled. "That's exactly right. English or education—appropriate fields for a young woman. Nothing too ambitious, nothing that suggests you're trying to compete with men."

Nothing that suggests I have thoughts of my own, I added silently.

The morning sun slanted through the kitchen window, painting everything in golden light that should have been warm but felt flat somehow. Outside, I could see our carefully tended lawn, the white picket fence, the American flag Father insisted we fly every day. Beach Hill—Liberty Beach's "nice" neighborhood—stretched beyond in neat rows of Victorian houses and elm trees. Everything proper. Everything perfect. Everything exactly as it should be.

I felt like I was suffocating.

"Eat up, sweetheart," Father said, draining his coffee cup. "We need to leave in twenty minutes. First impressions matter."

I picked up my fork and took another bite of eggs I couldn't taste.

Twenty minutes later, Mother inspected me one final time. She adjusted my pearls, checked my seams, brushed invisible lint from my shoulder.

"Remember," she said softly. "Smile. Be gracious. Don't contradict anyone, especially not your father. Compliment Mrs. Henderson on her hat. Ask Mr. Thompson about his grandchildren. Make David feel special without being too forward."

"Yes, Mother." The words came automatically.

She studied my face, and for just a moment I thought I saw something in her expression—a flicker of something that might have been understanding, or sadness, or maybe just my imagination. Then it was gone.

"You look perfect, darling."

Perfect. That word again.

In the car—Father's pristine 1955 Buick Special—I sat in the back seat watching Liberty Beach roll past. Main Street with its neat row of shops, Miller's General Store with its red-white-and-blue bunting already up, Harper's Drugstore where teenagers gathered at the soda fountain, McCarthy's Diner with chrome fixtures gleaming. The Liberty Theater marquee advertised "Old Yeller."

Everything in Liberty Beach was wholesome. Proper. Traditional.

Everything except me, apparently. Or maybe I was too perfect—so perfect I'd forgotten how to be real.

Father drove past the docks, and I caught a glimpse of the working waterfront—fishing boats unloading their morning catches, women in hairnets heading into the cannery for their shifts, a mechanic's garage with its door open and an engine visible on the lift inside. Wade's Garage, the sign said. I'd heard Father mention the Wades in his speeches, usually as examples of "wasted potential" or "lack of ambition."

I wondered what it was like to work with your hands, to fix things, to do something real and tangible that wasn't about appearances and impressions. To have grease under your fingernails instead of perfect manicured polish.

The thought lasted only a moment before I pushed it away. Girls like me didn't think about places like that. Girls like me went to country club breakfasts and smiled and agreed and performed.

The country club sat on the north end of Liberty Beach, overlooking the bay with its rolling lawns and white columns and members-only exclusivity. Father pulled into the parking lot, finding a space near the entrance. He cut the engine and turned to look at me.

"Ready, Katie-girl?"

I reached for the smile—the perfect, practiced, absolutely meaningless smile—and found it waiting like an old friend.

"Ready, Father."

Mother checked her lipstick in her compact mirror. Father straightened his tie. I smoothed my skirt one more time.

Then we stepped out of the car and into our roles, the Morrison family united in presentation and purpose. Father, the dedicated mayor seeking re-election to continue his good work. Mother, the supportive wife and pillar of the community. And me, Katherine Morrison, the perfect daughter who made her family proud.

I wondered, as I walked toward the country club entrance with the morning sun warm on my shoulders and my smile locked firmly in place, if the real Kate Morrison—whoever she might be—was still in there somewhere. Or if I'd performed her into extinction.

The heavy door swung open. The campaign breakfast waited inside.

I stopped wondering and started performing.

After all, that's what I did best.
