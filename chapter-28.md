# Chapter 28: Aftermath

The ride home was silent.

Father drove, jaw tight, hands gripping the steering wheel. Mother sat beside him, staring straight ahead. I sat in the backseat alone—Lucas had gone home with his father, giving my family space for the conversation we all knew was coming.

Nobody spoke until we were safely inside the house, door closed against prying eyes and gossiping neighbors.

Then Mother turned on me.

"How could you?" Her voice shook with fury and hurt. "How could you humiliate us like that? In front of the entire town! Kissing that boy during the fireworks, making a spectacle—"

"Eleanor," Father said quietly.

"No, Richard! She needs to hear this!" Mother's composure, so carefully maintained all evening, shattered. "Do you have any idea what you've done, Katherine? Your father's campaign, our reputation, years of work building our position in this community—ruined! Destroyed by your selfish teenage rebellion!"

"It wasn't rebellion," I said, trying to stay calm. "It was a choice. My choice."

"You're sixteen! You don't get to make choices that destroy your family!"

"I'm not destroying the family. I'm just being honest about who I am."

Mother laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Honest? You want to talk about honesty? After sneaking around with that boy, lying to us about where you were, pretending to go along with the dance and David while planning this—this performance all along?"

"I did lie about where I was," I admitted. "And I'm sorry for that. But I didn't plan what happened tonight. I didn't go to the celebration intending to walk away from Father's speech."

"Then why did you?" Father spoke for the first time since we'd left Town Square. His voice was eerily calm.

I turned to face him. "Because standing backstage, waiting for my cue, I realized that if I walked out on that stage, I'd be confirming something. Accepting that my role is to be your political asset. Forever."

"That's not your role—"

"Yes it is." I interrupted gently but firmly. "Father, be honest. When you think about me, do you think about Kate? Or do you think about the mayor's daughter? About photo opportunities and campaign appearances and how my behavior affects poll numbers?"

Father opened his mouth. Closed it. Something flickered across his face—maybe recognition, maybe shame.

"I love you," I continued. "Both of you. And I'm grateful for everything you've given me. But I can't be who you need me to be anymore. I can't perform perfect daughter while the real me disappears."

"This is about that boy," Mother said bitterly. "Lucas Wade has put these ideas in your head—"

"Lucas didn't put anything in my head," I interrupted. "He just saw what was already there. The parts of me I'd been hiding because they weren't appropriate or acceptable or politically advantageous."

"You think you're in love," Mother said. "You think this summer romance is real and lasting. But Kate, it's not. You'll go to college, meet other boys, have other experiences. This feeling will fade."

"Maybe it will," I admitted. "I'm sixteen. I don't know if Lucas and I will last forever. But that's not the point. The point is that for the first time in my life, I'm choosing something for myself. Not because it helps Father's campaign or maintains our reputation or looks good in photographs. Because it's what I actually want."

"What you want is to throw your life away," Mother said.

"What I want is to have a life that's actually mine!"

The words came out louder than I'd intended. Mother flinched.

Father moved to the window, looking out at Beach Hill. "The phone's been ringing," he said quietly. "Campaign volunteers, constituents, even some reporters. Everyone wants to know what's going on with the Morrison family."

"I'm sorry," I said. And I was sorry for the stress, for the complications. Just not sorry for my choice.

"Mr. Henderson thinks we can manage this," Father continued, still facing the window. "Frame it as a family going through normal teenage challenges. Show understanding and compassion. Turn it into a humanizing moment instead of a scandal."

Of course. Even now, political strategy. Damage control. Managing the narrative.

"Is that all I am to you?" I asked quietly. "A narrative to manage?"

Father turned then, and the look on his face stopped my breath. He looked older than I'd ever seen him. Tired. Hurt.

"No," he said. "You're my daughter. My Katie-bird. The little girl who used to ride on my shoulders at campaign events, who helped me practice speeches in our living room, who was so proud when I won my first election."

"I was eight years old, Father. I didn't know what I was proud of."

"Maybe not then. But later—you seemed to understand. To want to help. To care about what we were building."

"I did care," I said honestly. "I do care. About Liberty Beach, about the work you've done. But Father, I've cared about your dreams my whole life. I've supported your ambitions, your campaign, your vision for this town. When do I get to care about my own dreams?"

"After college," Father said. "After you've established yourself. After—"

"After I've spent another six years performing who you need me to be?" I shook my head. "No. I can't do that. I won't."

"Then what do you want?" Mother demanded. "To throw away your education? Marry Lucas Wade at seventeen and work at his father's garage?"

"I want to finish high school," I said calmly. "Go to college, probably. Figure out what I'm actually interested in instead of what looks good on applications. And yes, I want to date Lucas. Not because I'm planning to marry him next week, but because he sees me as Kate instead of as your daughter or Father's asset or the perfect girl everyone expects."

"He's using you," Mother insisted. "Can't you see that? He's the troubled boy from the wrong side of town, and you're the mayor's daughter. This gives him status, gets him noticed—"

"Lucas tried to release me," I interrupted. "He walked away to protect his family from Father's political retaliation. He didn't want me to choose him if it meant destroying your campaign. He was being noble and self-sacrificing." I looked at Father. "Which is more than you were being when you threatened to destroy his father's business."

Father had the grace to look uncomfortable.

"I did apologize for that," he said.

"You did. And I appreciate it. But Father, do you understand why you did it in the first place? Why your first instinct was to use political power against innocent people to control your daughter's behavior?"

"To protect you—"

"To control me," I corrected. "And to protect your campaign. Be honest. If dating Lucas didn't threaten your re-election, would you even care?"

Father was quiet for a long moment. Then, slowly, he shook his head. "I don't know. Maybe not."

The admission hung in the air.

"I've become what I criticized in Robert Caldwell," Father said quietly. "Using my position for personal benefit. Putting political advantage over principled behavior." He sank into his armchair, suddenly looking exhausted. "When did that happen?"

"Gradually," I said gently. "Over eight years of campaigns and strategies and poll numbers. You didn't wake up one day deciding to be that person. You just made small compromises until you forgot what you'd compromised."

Mother sat down beside Father, taking his hand. For the first time, they looked unified not by political strategy but by genuine emotion. Confusion. Hurt. Love.

"We wanted the best for you," Mother said, voice breaking. "Everything we did—the etiquette lessons, the carefully chosen activities, the expectations—we thought we were preparing you for a good life."

"You were preparing me for your version of a good life," I said. "Which maybe would have been fine if you'd also let me discover my own version."

"And this is your version?" Father gestured vaguely. "Dating the town troublemaker? Publicly defying us?"

"No," I said honestly. "This is me figuring out my version. Making choices, making mistakes probably, but making them myself. That's what I need, Father. The chance to be me instead of who you designed me to be."

The grandfather clock chimed midnight. The Fourth of July was officially over. The celebration I'd organized, the spectacle I'd created, the choice I'd made—all now history.

"I don't approve," Father said finally. "I don't approve of Lucas, of this relationship, of how you handled tonight. But Katie... I also don't know how to make you be someone you're not. And maybe—maybe I shouldn't try."

It wasn't acceptance. Wasn't enthusiasm. But it was acknowledgment. Recognition that I was a person separate from his ambitions.

It was a start.

Mother was crying softly. I went to her, kneeling beside her chair.

"I'm still your daughter," I said quietly. "I still love you. I'm just also Kate. My own person. Can you understand that?"

Mother touched my face, and her hand shook. "I'm trying. God help me, I'm trying."

We sat together in the living room—the Morrison family, fractured but still family. Trying to find a way forward that honored both their expectations and my autonomy.

It wouldn't be easy. Father's campaign would be damaged. Mother's social circle would gossip. I'd face consequences at school, in town, everywhere.

But I'd faced myself. And I'd chosen truth.

Whatever came next, I'd meet it as Kate Morrison.

Not the mayor's perfect daughter.

Just Kate.

Finally, blessedly, inevitably me.
