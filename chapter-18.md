# Chapter 18: Impossible Pressure

The next two days passed in a blur of controlled chaos. Father watched me constantly, his gaze following me through the house like I was a flight risk who might bolt at any moment. Maybe I was.

Mother had scheduled every minute. Thursday morning: hair appointment at Patricia's Beauty Parlor. Thursday afternoon: final dress fitting at Patterson's Department Store. Thursday evening: family dinner where we'd practice looking united and happy. Friday morning: Fourth of July committee meeting to finalize details. Friday afternoon: rest and preparation. Friday evening: the dance.

There was no space to think. No time to question. That was the point, I realized. Keep Kate busy, keep Kate supervised, keep Kate from changing her mind.

At breakfast Thursday, Father looked up from the Gazette. "The latest polls are encouraging. This dance tomorrow should put us back on track entirely."

This dance. As if it were a campaign strategy instead of my life.

"That's wonderful, dear," Mother said. She glanced at me. "Kate, you're not eating."

I looked at my untouched plate. My stomach had been in knots since Tuesday night. "I'm not hungry."

"You need your strength. Big day tomorrow."

Big day. Performance day.

I forced down a bite of toast. It tasted like cardboard.

After breakfast, Mother drove me to Patricia's Beauty Parlor. The shop smelled like hairspray and permanent solution.

"Katherine Morrison! Your mother tells me we're creating something special." Mrs. Patricia guided me to a chair. "Victory rolls, very classic. You'll look just like a movie star."

I sat watching in the mirror as she pinned and rolled and sprayed. Mother supervised, making suggestions. "Perhaps a bit higher there. Yes, perfect. Very elegant."

Elegant. Appropriate. Perfect. The same words until they lost all meaning.

Other women came and went, getting their own hair done. They all had opinions about my upcoming dance.

"Such a nice boy, that David Hartwell," Mrs. Agnes Miller said from the next chair over. Of course she was here. Agnes was everywhere. "Much more suitable than—well, we won't talk about that unpleasantness. Water under the bridge now."

"Completely forgotten," another woman agreed. "Everyone makes mistakes when they're young. The important thing is that Kate came to her senses."

I sat motionless while they discussed me like I wasn't there. Like I was a problem that had been solved, a scandal that had been contained, a wayward daughter who'd been brought back into line.

"You must be so relieved, Eleanor," Agnes said to my mother. "These teenage romances can be so difficult. But Katherine's always been such a sensible girl."

Sensible. Was that what I was? Or just thoroughly trained?

After two hours, Mrs. Patricia proclaimed me perfect. I looked in the mirror and saw the mayor's daughter—hair immaculate, every bit of authenticity hidden beneath polish.

Mother drove us to Patterson's for the dress fitting. Minor alterations. I stood on the platform while Mrs. Patterson pinned and fussed.

"You look beautiful, dear. Like something from a magazine."

Exactly like a magazine. Glossy, two-dimensional, not quite real.

We returned home to find Father's campaign manager, Mr. Henderson, waiting with folders.

"I wanted to brief you on tomorrow's logistics." He opened a folder. "The photographer will be positioned near the entrance. We've arranged for you to arrive during peak attendance—maximum visibility. After photos, Katherine should circulate, interact positively with voters."

"Interact positively with voters," I repeated. "Not just attend a dance?"

Mr. Henderson blinked. "Of course you'll enjoy yourself. But it's also an opportunity to repair the campaign's image."

Everything was strategy. Every moment calculated for political advantage.

Father joined us. "Kate understands the importance of tomorrow. Don't you, Kate?"

"Yes, sir."

They spent thirty minutes mapping out the evening like a military operation. Where I should stand, who to talk to, how long to stay. David had been briefed separately. We were actors in a choreographed play, hitting our marks.

"Stay until at least nine-thirty," Mr. Henderson said. "Shows confidence. Shows you're not hiding."

Shows, shows, shows. Everything was about the show.

After Mr. Henderson left, Mother announced family dinner rehearsal. "We need to practice looking natural together."

We sat around the table—pot roast and potatoes. Mother had put out the good china even though it was just us. Practice being perfect even in private.

Father talked about campaign developments. Mother discussed committee work. I pushed food around my plate.

"You seem distracted, Kate," Father observed.

"Just thinking about the celebration planning."

"I've reviewed your Fourth of July schedule. Everything looks excellent. You've done a wonderful job."

A wonderful job. His campaign showcase, his redemption. And I'd organized every detail.

That night, I lay awake. Tomorrow was the dance. Tomorrow I'd officially end whatever I'd had with Lucas.

My door opened softly. Mother, in her robe, carrying something.

"Can't sleep?"

I shook my head.

She sat on my bed and handed me a velvet box. "This was my grandmother's. She gave it to me when I was sixteen." Inside was a delicate silver bracelet with tiny pearls. "Wear it tomorrow. For luck."

"Thank you," I whispered.

Mother smoothed my hair back like she used to when I was little. "I know you think we're being cruel. But someday you'll understand. Someday you'll have a daughter, and you'll do whatever it takes to protect her. Even if she hates you for it."

"I don't hate you."

"But you're angry. And hurt." Her voice was soft. "But the hurt will pass. And you'll still have your reputation, your future. Those things last. Summer romances don't."

After she left, I held the bracelet and wondered if she was right. Maybe in ten years I'd barely remember Lucas's name.

Or maybe I'd spend my life wondering who I might have been if I'd been brave enough to choose myself.

Friday morning arrived too quickly. Fourth of July committee meeting at Town Square.

I arrived with my clipboard, the efficient chairman everyone expected. Campaign volunteers were setting up decorations—bunting, flags, patriotic displays.

"Katherine! We need you to check the stage setup."

I walked to the wooden stage erected in the center square. This was where Father would give his Fourth of July speech. Where I'd stand beside him, visual proof of family unity.

The podium was off-center. I directed workers to adjust it, checking sightlines and photo angles. Expert at thinking about how things would look in pictures.

"All ready for tonight?" Mrs. Henderson asked. "I heard David bought you a beautiful corsage."

"I'm looking forward to it," I said automatically.

Was I? No. I was dreading every minute.

The meeting dragged on. Fireworks timing, speech schedules, vendor locations. I answered questions, solved problems, kept perfect notes. The efficient Kate Morrison, always reliable.

By the time I got home, Mother had laid out everything. Dress, pearls, cardigan, shoes. Ready for my transformation.

"Rest for a few hours. You want to look fresh."

I lay on my bed but couldn't sleep. My mind drifted to Lucas. Did he know about the dance? Of course he did. Everyone in Liberty Beach knew everything. He probably understood exactly what it meant.

I wondered if he was hurt or just resigned. Lucas had always known we were from different worlds.

But I hadn't. I'd thought, briefly, wildly, that maybe it could work. That maybe being real was more important than being appropriate.

How naive.

At six o'clock, Mother knocked on my door. "Time to get ready, sweetheart."

I sat up, stomach churning. "Mother, I—"

"I know," she said gently. "It's hard. But you're doing the right thing. I promise you're doing the right thing."

She helped me into the pink dress, zipped it carefully. The pearls went around my neck, cool against my skin. The bracelet on my wrist. The cardigan over my shoulders. Mary Jane shoes, polished to gleaming.

Mother stood back and surveyed me with satisfaction. "Perfect. Absolutely perfect."

I looked in the mirror. The girl staring back looked exactly right. Hair immaculate, dress appropriate, expression pleasant. The mayor's perfect daughter.

Inside, I was screaming.

The doorbell rang at seven-twenty. David, precisely on time, holding a corsage of pink roses.

"You look beautiful, Kate," he said with genuine admiration.

"Thank you," I replied. "You look very nice too."

We stood in the foyer while Father took photographs with his camera. Mother fussed over the corsage placement. We smiled and posed, the perfect couple heading to the perfect dance.

"Have a wonderful time," Father said. "Remember—"

"I know," I interrupted. "Be seen, interact positively, stay until nine-thirty minimum."

Father frowned at my tone, but Mother touched his arm. "She knows, dear. She'll be wonderful."

David offered his arm. I took it. We walked to his father's Buick, gleaming at the curb.

As we drove toward the dance, David made pleasant conversation about the weather and the celebration planning and his summer job at his father's law office. I made appropriate responses, my performance so automatic I didn't have to think about it.

We arrived at the dance venue—the Liberty Beach Community Center, decorated with streamers and balloons in red, white, and blue. Cars already filled the parking lot. Music drifted from inside.

The photographer from the Gazette waited by the entrance, exactly as planned.

"Ready?" David asked.

No. I wasn't ready. I'd never be ready.

"Yes," I said.

We stepped out of the car. The photographer's flash went off, catching us in its blinding light. Click. Click. Click. Capturing the moment for tomorrow's front page.

The mayor's daughter, back where she belonged.

Appropriate. Sensible. Perfect.

Dying inside.
