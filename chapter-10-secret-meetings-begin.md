# Chapter 10: Secret Meetings Begin

I became an expert at lying.

"I need to confirm the vendor contracts."

"The fireworks coordinator needs to review safety protocols."

"Mrs. Henderson wants me to inspect the bunting."

"The parade marshal has questions."

Mother accepted every excuse. Father praised my dedication. David said I was working too hard, maybe I should take a break?

I smiled and said the celebration was important.

What I didn't say: the celebration gave me cover for the only real thing in my life.

Thursday afternoon, I brought Lucas a book.

"What's this?" He looked at the paperback I'd pulled from my bag—"The Rebel" by Camus.

"You said you liked Camus. I found this at the library." I settled onto the pier beside him. "It's about rebellion and freedom and refusing to accept absurd conditions."

Lucas flipped through the pages, something unreadable in his expression. "You got this for me?"

"Is that okay? I thought you might like it, but if you've already read it—"

"I haven't. And yes, it's okay. It's more than okay." He looked at me. "Nobody's ever given me a book before."

"Really? Never?"

"Kate, most people think I barely read comic books. You're the only one who knows I care about philosophy."

The words settled warm in my chest. I was the only one.

We spent that afternoon reading together in companionable silence—Lucas starting "The Rebel," me working through a collection of short stories. Every so often, he'd read a passage aloud, and we'd discuss it. The afternoon sun painted the water gold. Seagulls wheeled overhead. The world felt far away.

"Listen to this," Lucas said. "'What is a rebel? A man who says no, but whose refusal does not imply a renunciation. He is also a man who says yes, from the moment he makes his first gesture of rebellion.'"

"Says yes to what?"

"To himself. To his own values. To the idea that some things matter enough to resist." Lucas looked at me. "You're rebelling, you know. By coming here."

"This doesn't feel like rebellion. It feels like breathing."

"Maybe that's what rebellion is. Choosing to breathe when everyone wants you to suffocate."

I thought about that for a long moment. "Have you rebelled? Or just accepted the label they gave you?"

Lucas closed the book. "Honestly? I stopped fighting it. Easier to be what they expect than to keep hoping they'll see something different."

"That's not rebellion. That's surrender."

"Harsh but accurate." He smiled wryly. "What about you? Is sneaking away to talk to me rebellion or just temporary escape?"

"I don't know yet."

"Fair answer."

Friday, I taught Lucas to skip stones properly.

"You're throwing them wrong," I said, laughing as his attempt plunked straight down. "You need to angle it. Like this."

I demonstrated—the stone skipped twice before sinking.

"Wow. Two whole skips. I'm intimidated by your expertise."

"Shut up." I handed him another stone. "Flatten your wrist. Snap your release. Try again."

He tried. The stone skipped once.

"Better! See? You just needed proper instruction."

"From the stone-skipping champion of Liberty Beach."

"Mock me all you want. I'm still better at this than you."

Lucas grinned, and something in my chest fluttered. When had his smile started affecting me like this?

We spent an hour throwing stones, keeping score, trash-talking each other's technique. I couldn't remember the last time I'd been this silly. The perfect mayor's daughter didn't giggle or boast or deliberately splash someone when they won.

But Kate did. And it felt wonderful.

Monday, Lucas showed me his motorcycle.

"This is what you built from scrap?" I circled the machine parked near Wade's Garage, genuinely impressed. The chrome gleamed in the afternoon sun. Every line was clean, purposeful. "Lucas, this is beautiful."

"Thanks." He ran a hand over the seat with obvious pride. "Took me two years. Rebuilt the engine completely, fabricated custom parts, did all the electrical myself."

"Can I touch it?"

"Yeah, of course."

I traced the smooth metal, the careful welding seams, the elegant curves. This wasn't just transportation. This was art.

"Do you ride it a lot?"

"Every chance I get. It's freedom, you know? On this bike, I'm not the troublemaker or Tom Wade's son. I'm just me, moving fast, going wherever I want."

"That sounds amazing."

Lucas looked at me thoughtfully. "Want to try?"

"Try what?"

"Sitting on it. Seeing what it feels like."

My heart jumped. "I shouldn't—"

"Why not? Because mayor's daughters don't sit on motorcycles?" He grinned. "Come on, Kate. Nobody's watching. It's just us."

He was right. We were alone at the garage, his father out on a service call.

"Okay," I said. "Show me."

Lucas swung his leg over, settling into position. "Here. Behind me. Put your feet on the pegs—there. Arms around my waist for balance."

I climbed on behind him, hyperaware of every point of contact. His leather jacket under my hands. The warmth of his back against my chest. My arms circling his waist.

"Like this?" My voice came out breathier than intended.

"Perfect." Lucas's voice sounded different too. "Now imagine we're moving. Wind in your face. Road underneath. No destination, just movement and choice and freedom."

I closed my eyes and imagined it. Not the careful, controlled life I'd always known, but this—speed and wind and choosing my own direction.

"I wish we could actually ride," I whispered.

"Someday maybe." Lucas's hand covered mine where it rested on his stomach. "When you're ready to stop hiding."

The words stung and thrilled simultaneously.

We sat there for a long moment, not moving, just breathing together. Then reality intruded—I heard voices from the street—and I scrambled off the motorcycle, smoothing my dress, checking my hair.

Back to being perfect Kate. The performance snapping into place.

But I could still feel the warmth of his back against my chest. The promise of freedom.

Wednesday, we talked about music.

"What do you actually listen to?" Lucas asked. "Not what your parents approve of. What you'd choose."

"I don't know. I've never really chosen."

"Then let's find out." He pulled out his transistor radio. "Listen to this."

Chuck Berry poured from the tinny speaker—"Johnny B. Goode," fast and rebellious and alive. Nothing like the Patti Page and Perry Como my mother played at home.

"Oh," I breathed. "This is—"

"Great, right? That's real music. Not the sanitized stuff they play for the country club set."

The rhythm got into my blood. My foot started tapping.

"You like it," Lucas observed, grinning.

"I love it." The admission felt dangerous. "Is that allowed? Can I love something my parents would hate?"

"Kate, you can like whatever you want. That's the point."

He turned up the radio. Little Richard came on next, then Buddy Holly, then more Chuck Berry. Music that made me want to move, to feel, to be alive instead of perfect.

"Dance with me," I said impulsively.

Lucas looked surprised. "Here? On the pier?"

"Why not? Nobody's watching."

So we danced on weathered planks above the water, rock and roll crackling from the radio, both of us laughing and terrible at it and not caring because it was real.

His hands on my waist. My hands on his shoulders. Neither of us knowing the proper steps and inventing our own instead.

It was nothing like dancing with David at the sock hop—careful, prescribed, performative.

This was messy and honest and perfect.

When the song ended, we stood there breathing hard, grinning at each other.

"That was fun," I said.

"Yeah." Lucas's eyes held mine. "It was."

Something had shifted between us. Something more than friendship but less than whatever we were too scared to name.

By the end of the week, I'd memorized the pier's rhythm. Which boards creaked. Which pilings had the best barnacles for throwing stones at. Where the sun hit in the afternoon. How the water sounded at different times.

I'd also memorized Lucas. The way his left eyebrow raised when he was skeptical. His habit of drumming fingers when he was thinking. The scar through his eyebrow from a fight in eighth grade. How his voice changed when he talked about motorcycles—softer, more hopeful.

The way he looked at me when I said something honest.

"You're smiling," Lucas observed Friday afternoon.

"Am I?"

"Yeah. Real smile, not the political one." He bumped my shoulder with his. "What are you thinking about?"

"This. Us. These meetings." I looked out at the water. "I know it's temporary. I know we're stealing time that doesn't really belong to us. I know it can't last."

"But?"

"But right now, in this moment, I'm happy." The admission felt both brave and terrifying. "Is that selfish? To be happy doing something I have to hide?"

"I don't think happiness is selfish."

"Even when it's built on lies?"

Lucas was quiet for a moment. "You're not lying about how you feel. You're just lying about where you are. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"Yeah. The first is performance. The second is survival."

I wanted to believe him. Wanted to think that what we had—these stolen afternoons, these honest conversations, this growing something between us—was worth the lies I told to protect it.

"Lucas," I said carefully. "What are we doing? Really?"

"Being real. Being ourselves. Being honest about who we are when nobody's watching."

"That's not an answer."

"What do you want me to say, Kate?" He turned to face me fully. "That we're friends? We're more than friends. That we're dating? We can't be because you have a boyfriend and I'm not allowed in your world. That we're falling for each other? Maybe, but saying it out loud makes it real and real is dangerous."

My heart hammered. "So what do we call this?"

"Ours," Lucas said simply. "This is ours. Whatever it is, it belongs to us. And for now, that's enough."

"Is it? Really enough?"

"It has to be." His eyes held mine. "Because anything more means you choose between this and your family. And I won't ask you to make that choice."

But we both knew, sitting on that pier in the fading afternoon light, that eventually the choice would come.

Because secret meetings couldn't stay secret forever.

And when truth came out—as it always did in Liberty Beach—we'd both have to decide what we were willing to lose for what we'd found.

For now, though, we had the pier.

We had stolen afternoons and honest conversations.

We had each other, in the only way we were allowed.

And despite everything, despite the fear and the lies and the impossibility of it all, I'd never been happier.

Even if I knew it couldn't last.

Even if I was terrified of what came next.

Even if every meeting felt like borrowed time running out.
