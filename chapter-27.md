# Chapter 27: Public Declaration

We returned to the celebration as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple. The fireworks crew was making final preparations on the beach. Soon the spectacular finale I'd planned would light up the bay.

Lucas and I walked hand-in-hand through Town Square. People stared—of course they stared—but their reactions varied. Some looked disapproving. Others curious. A few—mostly younger people—looked almost admiring.

Mrs. Miller watched us pass with eyes like a hawk. Tomorrow's gossip was already being composed in her head.

David had disappeared, probably to nurse his wounded dignity somewhere quiet. Jen and Tommy stood near the stage, Jen's expression caught between concern for her friend and fascination with the drama.

And my parents—Father had resumed his position near the stage, Mother beside him, both maintaining appearances despite everything. Campaign volunteers clustered around them, damage control in full swing.

"People are really staring," Lucas murmured.

"Let them." I squeezed his hand. "I'm done hiding."

The band finished their set. Mr. Henderson took the microphone to announce the fireworks display would begin in five minutes. People started migrating toward the beach for better views.

Lucas and I stood at the edge of the crowd, not quite in the spotlight but not hiding either. A middle ground—visible, together, real.

"Your father keeps looking over here," Lucas observed.

I glanced toward the stage. Father was indeed watching us while trying to appear like he wasn't. His expression was unreadable—politician's mask firmly in place.

"He's probably deciding how to spin this for the campaign," I said. "Mayor shows understanding and compassion for wayward daughter. Family values include forgiveness and growth."

Lucas laughed softly. "Cynical."

"Realistic." But I smiled too. "Though maybe I'm being unfair. He did apologize to your dad. That's something."

"Your parents are complicated," Lucas said diplomatically.

"That's one word for them."

The first firework shrieked into the sky—a test shot, making sure everything was ready. It exploded in a fountain of white sparks that cascaded down like a waterfall.

The crowd murmured appreciatively. Children pressed closer to the beach. Couples found spots to watch together.

And Lucas and I stood in the gathering dusk, at the edge of everything, together.

"I still can't believe you did it," he said quietly. "Walked away from that stage. Chose this over everything you've ever known."

"I chose myself," I corrected. "You were just the catalyst. The person who showed me what authenticity looked like."

"Some catalyst. Got you in trouble with your parents, ruined your father's campaign moment, made you the talk of the town."

"Best trouble I've ever been in," I said honestly.

Lucas turned to face me fully, hands on my shoulders. "Kate Morrison, I need you to understand something. This isn't going to be easy. People will judge us. Your parents will make rules. The town will gossip. We're from different worlds, and those divisions don't just disappear because we want them to."

"I know."

"And I'm still just a troublemaker from the docks. I can't give you the life David Hartwell could. No country club, no political connections, no guaranteed future of comfort and status."

"I don't want that life," I said. "I want a real life. With real feelings and real choices. Even if it's harder."

"It will be harder," Lucas warned.

"Good." I smiled. "I'm tired of easy. Easy means performing. Easy means hiding. I'd rather have hard and real than easy and fake."

The announcement came: "Ladies and gentlemen, the Liberty Beach Fourth of July fireworks display will begin in one minute!"

People settled into position. The beach was packed now, hundreds of faces turned toward the bay where the fireworks barges waited.

Father and Mother stood near the stage with campaign volunteers. From this distance, they looked like the perfect political couple—unified, confident, in control.

But I knew better. Underneath that polished exterior was confusion, anger, fear. Fear that their daughter was slipping away from everything they'd planned for her.

Maybe I was. But I was slipping toward something too—toward myself. Toward authenticity. Toward truth.

The countdown began. "Ten... nine... eight..."

Lucas pulled me closer. "You know everyone's still watching us, right?"

"I know."

"And if I kiss you right now, during the fireworks, it'll be the most public declaration possible. No taking it back. No claiming it was a mistake or momentary lapse in judgment."

"I know that too."

"Seven... six... five..."

"Your mother might actually faint."

"She'll survive."

"Four... three... two..."

Lucas cupped my face in his hands. "Last chance to change your mind. To walk away. To choose the safe path."

I looked into his eyes—Lucas Wade, troublemaker, bad boy, the one person who'd seen past my performance to the real Kate underneath.

"One!"

The first firework launched with a shriek and a boom.

"I don't want safe," I said.

And I kissed him.

Not a secret kiss stolen at the old pier. Not a hidden moment we'd have to pretend never happened. This was a public kiss, in front of hundreds of people, during the fireworks finale I'd organized, at the celebration meant to redeem my father's campaign.

This was a declaration. A choice. A line drawn in the sand.

The firework exploded overhead in cascades of red, white, and blue—my carefully planned display creating patterns across the night sky. Each burst more spectacular than the last, the finale I'd designed to be the perfect climax to Father's perfect campaign event.

And I was kissing Lucas Wade while Liberty Beach watched.

I heard gasps from nearby. Heard someone—probably Mrs. Miller—exclaim in shock. Heard the whispers spreading like ripples in water.

But mostly I heard nothing but my own heartbeat and the boom of fireworks overhead.

Lucas held me like I was precious. Like I was brave. Like I was exactly who I was supposed to be.

When we finally broke apart, the sky was full of color—reds and blues and whites and golds, all the fireworks launching in rapid succession now, building toward the grand finale.

We stood in the glow of falling sparks, and Lucas smiled at me. "Well, that's done it. No going back now."

"Good." I was breathing hard, heart racing. "I don't want to go back."

Around us, the crowd had mostly turned back to the fireworks—spectacle in the sky winning out over spectacle on the ground. But I caught glimpses of reactions: shock, disapproval, a few knowing smiles from younger couples who understood what it meant to choose love over expectation.

And there, near the stage—my parents. Father's face was unreadable in the fireworks' glow. Mother looked stricken.

I'd hurt them. I knew that. This public kiss was more than teenage romance—it was rejection of everything they'd tried to make me.

But it was also affirmation of who I actually was.

The grand finale began—dozens of fireworks launching simultaneously, filling the sky with color and light and sound. The spectacular climax I'd planned so carefully, now backdrop to my own declaration of independence.

"It's beautiful," Lucas said, watching the display.

"You should see it from the old pier," I told him. "Even better view."

"Someday maybe they won't condemn it," Lucas said. "Maybe your father will decide it's not worth the political capital to tear it down."

"Maybe." I leaned against him. "Or maybe we'll find new places that are just ours. Places where we can be real together."

The final volley launched—a massive shell that exploded into a perfect American flag, stars and stripes rendered in red, white, and blue fire. My masterpiece, the closing image of the celebration.

As it faded, the crowd erupted in applause. The Liberty Beach Fourth of July celebration was officially over. My last act as the perfect daughter, the efficient organizer, the campaign asset.

Now I was just Kate Morrison, the girl who'd kissed a boy during fireworks and chosen authenticity over approval.

The applause continued. People started to disperse, gathering their belongings, heading for cars, already discussing the evening's events.

And Lucas and I stood together in the fading light, hand-in-hand, while the crowd flowed around us.

"Ready to face your parents?" he asked.

I looked toward where Father and Mother stood, clearly waiting for me. This conversation would be difficult. Painful. Probably involve tears and recriminations and desperate attempts to make me see reason.

But I'd made my choice. Publicly. Irrevocably.

"Ready as I'll ever be," I said.

We walked together toward my parents. Toward the difficult conversation. Toward consequences and complications and all the messy reality of choosing yourself over expectations.

But we walked together.

And somehow, that made all the difference.

The fireworks smoke cleared, revealing stars. Real stars, not manufactured light. Natural beauty instead of carefully planned performance.

I'd spent sixteen years being a firework—spectacular, carefully timed, designed to dazzle.

But now I was ready to be a star.

Real. Constant. Authentically myself.

Even if it meant burning brighter but less predictably.

Even if it meant being judged instead of admired.

Even if it cost everything I'd thought I wanted.

Because what I actually wanted—authenticity, choice, truth—was worth any price.

Lucas squeezed my hand as we approached my parents.

And I squeezed back.

Ready for whatever came next.

Together.
