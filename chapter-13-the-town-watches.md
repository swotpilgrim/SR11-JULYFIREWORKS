# Chapter 13: The Town Watches

We lost track of time.

It was that simple, that careless, that devastating.

Lucas and I had been at the pier discussing "The Rebel"—he'd finally finished it—and the afternoon had stretched into early evening without either of us noticing. The conversation had flowed from Camus to personal rebellion to dreams we barely dared speak aloud.

"It's getting late," Lucas said finally, checking his watch. "Sun's almost down."

I looked at the sky—pink and gold fading to purple. My heart dropped. "What time is it?"

"Almost seven."

"Seven?" I scrambled to my feet. "I was supposed to be home an hour ago. Mother's going to—"

"Go. I'll walk you back."

"No, you can't. If we're seen together—"

"Kate, it's almost dark. I'm not letting you walk alone."

There was no time to argue. I gathered my things and we hurried across the pier, navigating the weak planks faster than safe.

By the time we reached the docks, dusk had settled over Liberty Beach. The working waterfront was quiet, fishermen long since home. We should have been invisible.

We weren't.

As we walked toward Main Street—too fast, too flustered, too obviously together—I saw her.

Mrs. Agnes Miller, standing outside her general store taking down the American flag for the evening. Her eyes widened as she spotted us.

Lucas and I were twenty feet apart—careful distance, nothing inappropriate. But coming from the direction of the abandoned pier at this hour, both of us windblown and flushed, me with my hair mussed and supplies clutched haphazardly...

The story wrote itself.

Mrs. Miller's expression shifted from surprise to delighted scandal in about two seconds.

"Good evening, Mrs. Miller," I said, trying for dignified normalcy.

"Katherine." Her voice was pleasant as poison. "Out late this evening?"

"Fourth of July committee business. Checking the pier for safety concerns."

It was a terrible lie—why would I be checking a condemned pier? But it was all I had.

"I see." Mrs. Miller's eyes flicked to Lucas, then back to me. "And Mr. Wade was helping with this safety inspection?"

"I was at my dad's garage," Lucas said evenly. "Saw Kate walking past and thought I should mention some concerns about the dock pilings. For the safety report."

Better lie than mine. Still not good enough.

Mrs. Miller smiled. "How thoughtful. Well, you should hurry home, dear. I'm sure your mother is wondering where you are."

The words were solicitous. The gleam in her eyes was pure gossip gold.

We parted ways—Lucas heading back to the docks, me walking toward Beach Hill with my stomach in knots. Behind me, I heard Mrs. Miller going back into her store. Where the telephone was. Where she could call half a dozen friends before dinner.

By the time I reached home, the damage was already done.

---

Mother was waiting in the front parlor, her expression carefully neutral in that way that meant she was furious.

"Katherine. Where have you been?"

"Fourth of July committee work. I'm sorry I'm late. Time got away from me."

"What kind of committee work keeps you out until seven o'clock without calling?"

I scrambled for believable details. "Safety inspections. Making sure everything's ready for the celebration. I lost track of time."

"I see." Mother set down her teacup with precise control. "And this had nothing to do with Lucas Wade?"

My heart stopped. "What?"

"Margaret Thompson called twenty minutes ago. She'd heard from Agnes Miller that you were seen walking with that boy near the docks at dusk."

The gossip chain. Faster than telephone wires.

"I ran into him," I said carefully. "He was leaving his father's garage. We talked briefly about—"

"Katherine, do not lie to me." Mother's voice went cold. "Agnes said you came from the direction of the old pier. Together. Looking windblown and disheveled."

"We were just talking—"

"Where?"

Silence.

"Katherine Morrison, answer me. Where were you?"

I couldn't tell her the truth—the condemned pier, our secret place, hours of conversation that had nothing to do with Fourth of July planning. But I also couldn't come up with a lie that would explain away what Mrs. Miller saw.

"We were talking," I said finally. "Just talking. Nothing inappropriate happened."

"The appearance of impropriety is the same as impropriety." Mother stood, advancing on me with controlled fury. "Do you have any idea what this looks like? The mayor's daughter sneaking around with the town troublemaker? During campaign season?"

"I wasn't sneaking—"

"Then what were you doing?"

"Having a conversation! Is that a crime?"

"Yes!" Mother's composure cracked. "When it's with him, during your father's election, when you're supposed to be setting an example—yes, Katherine, it is a crime! Against this family, against your father's career, against everything we've built!"

Tears stung my eyes. "I'm sorry."

"Sorry isn't enough." Mother's voice dropped dangerously low. "This ends now. You will not see Lucas Wade again. You will not speak to him. You will not acknowledge him if you pass on the street. Do you understand me?"

"Mother—"

"Do you understand?"

"Yes." The word came out broken.

"Good. Now go to your room. Your father and I will discuss how to manage this situation."

I fled upstairs, tears spilling over. In my room, I collapsed on my bed, trying not to sob loud enough for Mother to hear.

One careless moment. One miscalculation of time.

And now everything was ruined.

---

The phone rang forty minutes later.

I couldn't hear the conversation, but I heard Mother's tight responses drifting up the stairs. Heard Father come home, his voice rising in the parlor. Heard my name repeated over and over.

At eight o'clock, there was a knock on my door.

"Kate?" Jen's voice. "Can I come in?"

I opened the door. Jen stood there looking worried and sympathetic and uncomfortable all at once.

"How did you—"

"Your mom called mine. Asked if I could come talk to you." Jen slipped inside, closing the door. "Kate, what happened? The whole town is talking."

"Nothing happened. Lucas and I were just talking. We lost track of time. Mrs. Miller saw us and assumed—"

"Were you with him? Lucas Wade?" Jen's voice wasn't judgmental, just trying to understand.

I nodded miserably.

"Why?"

The question hung there. Why would I risk everything to spend time with someone I wasn't supposed to know?

"Because when I'm with him, I don't have to perform," I said quietly. "Because he sees me as Kate instead of as the mayor's daughter. Because for a few hours a week, I get to be real."

Jen sat beside me on the bed. "Oh, Kate."

"I know it was stupid. I know I should have been more careful. But Jen, I've never felt like this before. Like I actually exist as a person instead of as a campaign prop."

"Do you..." Jen hesitated. "Do you have feelings for him? Real feelings?"

Did I? We'd never said it aloud. Never acknowledged what was growing between us. But sitting on that pier with Lucas's hand in mine, talking about dreams and labels and impossible futures—

"Yes," I whispered. "I think I do."

Jen was quiet for a long moment. Then: "What about David?"

"I don't feel anything for David. I never have. Our fathers arranged it. I've been performing interest because that's what I do—perform what people want."

"Kate—"

"I know it's a disaster. I know my timing is terrible. I know I should have stayed away from Lucas and kept dating David and been the perfect daughter like I'm supposed to be." Tears started again. "But I couldn't. For the first time in my life, I wanted something that wasn't approved or appropriate or politically advantageous. I wanted to be seen. And Lucas sees me."

Jen put her arm around me. "I know. I get it. But Kate, your parents are really upset. Your dad's election is in six weeks. This kind of scandal—"

"I know."

"Mrs. Miller is telling everyone she saw you. Mrs. Henderson is apparently having opinions about it at her bridge game right now. By tomorrow, the whole town will know."

"I know," I repeated miserably.

"What are you going to do?"

"What can I do? Mother forbade me from seeing him again. Father's probably figuring out how to spin this for the campaign. I'm trapped."

"Do you want to stop seeing him?"

The question cut to the heart of it.

"No," I admitted. "But I don't have a choice."

Jen squeezed my shoulder. "You always have a choice, Kate. The question is what you're willing to risk for it."

After she left, I lay in bed staring at my ceiling.

One careless moment.

One person watching.

And now my secret was exposed, my parents were furious, and the whole town was gossiping about the mayor's daughter and the troublemaker.

I thought about Lucas—was he dealing with fallout too? Was his father angry? Were people looking at him differently, assuming the worst?

I thought about the pier—our place, our refuge, our neutral ground. Could I ever go back? Or was that taken from us too?

I thought about tomorrow—facing my parents, facing the town, facing the consequences of wanting something real.

And I thought about what Jen had asked: What was I willing to risk?

Everything, a quiet voice inside me answered. For him, for honesty, for the chance to be Kate instead of Katherine—I'd risk everything.

But did I have the courage to actually do it?

I didn't know.

All I knew was that lying here in my perfect bedroom in my perfect house, playing the role of perfect daughter while my heart ached for stolen afternoons and honest conversations—

I couldn't keep doing this.

Something had to change.

And change was coming whether I was ready or not.

Because Mrs. Agnes Miller had seen us.

And in Liberty Beach, being seen was the same as being caught.
