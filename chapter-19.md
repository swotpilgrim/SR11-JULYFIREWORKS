# Chapter 19: Collateral Damage

Lucas Wade arrived at his father's garage Friday morning expecting the usual—engine work, oil changes, the smell of grease and gasoline that had been the background of his life for seventeen years.

Instead, he found his father standing in the middle of the garage floor, face red with fury, waving a piece of paper like a weapon.

"Building inspector," Tom Wade spat the words. "After twenty years, suddenly we're not up to code. Suddenly we need expensive upgrades or they'll shut us down."

Lucas's stomach dropped. He knew. Immediately, instinctively, he knew exactly what this was.

"What kind of violations?" he asked quietly.

Tom consulted the paper, hands shaking with anger. "Electrical wiring doesn't meet current standards. Ventilation system inadequate. Fire suppression equipment outdated. Storage of flammable materials not properly contained." He looked up. "We've been doing business the same way for twenty years. Passed every inspection. Never had a single complaint. And now, two days after—"

He stopped himself, but Lucas heard what he didn't say. Two days after Mayor Morrison's daughter was spotted with Lucas. Two days after the scandal that threatened the campaign.

"How much?" Lucas asked.

"Five thousand dollars. Minimum." Tom crumpled the paper. "Where am I supposed to get five thousand dollars? And that's assuming we can even make the repairs in the thirty-day window they're giving us." He sank onto his work stool, suddenly looking older than his forty-two years. "This is political, Lucas. This is Morrison using his power to punish people who get in his way."

Lucas leaned against the workbench, feeling sick. His father didn't know. Tom Wade had no idea that Lucas was the real target, that his business was collateral damage in a campaign strategy to control the mayor's daughter.

"We'll figure it out," Lucas said, though he had no idea how.

"Figure it out?" Tom's voice rose. "I can't afford to lose this business. This garage is everything. It's how I feed your mother and Mary. It's how we keep a roof over our heads. And now some politician decides we're inconvenient, so he sends his inspectors to find violations that didn't matter yesterday."

"Dad—"

"I'm calling every customer we have," Tom continued, already moving toward the phone. "We'll work extra hours. I'll take out a loan if I have to. Morrison might have the power, but he doesn't get to destroy what I've built. Not without a fight."

Lucas watched his father dial, jaw set with determination, and felt something crack inside his chest. This was his fault. His father's business, his family's livelihood—at risk because Lucas had been stupid enough to think he could have something with Kate Morrison.

Stupid enough to think the mayor would just let it happen.

He left the garage before his father could see his face, before the guilt became visible. Outside, Main Street was busy with morning shoppers. Liberty Beach going about its normal Friday, oblivious to the Wade family crisis.

Lucas needed to think. He started walking, no particular destination, just movement to keep the thoughts from crushing him.

He'd known from the beginning this couldn't work. He'd known Kate was from a different world—the world of Beach Hill and country clubs and political campaigns. He was from the docks, from grease-stained hands and working-class pride. The town had decided who he was years ago: troublemaker, lost cause, wrong side of the tracks.

For a few weeks, with Kate, he'd let himself forget that. When she looked at him, she saw Lucas—not the reputation, not the label, not the convenient bad boy for the mayor to reference in speeches. Just him.

It had felt like enough.

But it wasn't enough against political power and social pressure and a father willing to destroy innocent people to control his daughter.

Lucas found himself outside Miller's General Store. Through the window, he could see Mrs. Miller behind the counter, talking animatedly with two women. Campaign volunteers, Lucas recognized them. Morrison's people.

He should keep walking. He didn't need to hear whatever they were saying.

But something made him stop. Some need to understand exactly what he'd cost his family. He moved closer to the window, close enough to hear through the glass.

"—such a relief," one of the women was saying. "When the scandal broke, we thought the campaign was finished. But Eleanor Morrison handled it beautifully. Very firm with Katherine."

"The girl needed a firm hand," Mrs. Miller agreed. "All that nonsense with the Wade boy. Teenage rebellion, nothing more. Though I must say, I'm surprised Katherine behaved so badly. She's always been such a sensible girl."

"Temporary insanity," the other woman laughed. "Thank goodness it was temporary. Did you see her at the pre-Fourth dance last night? With that nice Hartwell boy? Picture perfect. Made the front page this morning."

Lucas's breath caught. The dance. He'd known it was happening, but hearing confirmation felt like a punch to the gut.

"The Morrison family photograph ran alongside it," Mrs. Miller said. "All of them looking united and happy. Very effective damage control. The mayor's numbers are already recovering."

"Katherine's back on track," the first woman said with satisfaction. "Dating appropriately, organizing the Fourth of July celebration. Proving it was just a phase. A summer mistake."

A summer mistake. That's what he was. What they'd been together. A problem that had been solved, a scandal that had been contained.

"I heard she's going to stand with her father during his Fourth of July speech," the other woman added. "Visual proof of family values and unity. Very smart campaigning."

"Poor thing," Mrs. Miller said, though she didn't sound particularly sympathetic. "Must have been difficult, realizing she'd nearly ruined her father's career over a boy like that. But she came to her senses. That's what matters."

Lucas turned away from the window before they could see him standing there. His hands were clenched into fists, nails digging into his palms.

Kate was back on track. Dating David Hartwell. Standing with her father at campaign events. The front page of the paper, picture perfect.

She'd made her choice.

Lucas had known she would. Had known from the first time they talked that eventually reality would intrude. People like Kate Morrison didn't end up with people like Lucas Wade. That's just how the world worked.

But knowing it intellectually and hearing it confirmed by campaign volunteers discussing Kate's return to appropriate behavior—those were different things entirely.

He walked to the docks, to the smell of salt water and fish and honest work. His world, not hers. The invisible line they'd crossed for a few brief weeks was firmly back in place.

At the old pier, Lucas stood looking out at the bay. Their place. Where Kate had laughed and been real and let herself exist without performance. Where he'd shown her his motorcycle designs and talked about dreams he'd never admitted to anyone else.

The pier was condemned property. In his ultimatum, Mayor Morrison had threatened to have it demolished. Make sure nobody was using it, he'd said. Take away Lucas's refuge.

Take away the place where Kate had discovered herself.

Lucas understood now. This was what power looked like—the ability to threaten livelihoods, demolish refuges, control people through fear and political pressure. Morrison would destroy Lucas's father's business. He'd tear down this pier. He'd do whatever it took to ensure his daughter returned to her proper place.

And he'd already won.

Kate was at that dance last night, smiling for cameras with David Hartwell. Kate was organizing her father's campaign celebration. Kate was back to being the mayor's perfect daughter.

Lucas couldn't compete with that. Couldn't offer her anything but trouble and scandal and political liability.

The decent thing—the only thing—was to let her go. Not make her choose, not force her to sacrifice everything for him. Let her have the life she was meant for, even if it meant pretending these weeks hadn't mattered.

Even if it meant burying the truth they'd found together.

His father needed to keep his business. Kate needed to keep her family and future. And Lucas—

Lucas would go back to being the troublemaker everyone expected. The label he'd been trying to escape with Kate's help. It was easier anyway, accepting what people thought instead of fighting it. Less painful than hoping for something different.

He stood at the old pier until the sun was high overhead, watching seagulls dive for fish, listening to waves lap against pilings. Memorizing this place before Morrison had it torn down.

Then Lucas turned and walked back toward Main Street.

He had to find Kate. Had to tell her before she heard it from someone else. Had to release her from any obligation she felt, any guilt about choosing her family over him.

It was the right thing to do.

Even if it broke what was left of his heart.

Lucas walked with purpose now, each step carrying him toward Town Square where Kate would be at her Fourth of July meeting, efficiently organizing the celebration that would redeem her father's campaign.

He'd tell her it was okay. Tell her he understood. Tell her their summer friendship had been nice but it was time to face reality.

He'd lie with every word.

But at least she'd be free. Free from guilt, free from pressure, free to be the mayor's daughter without the complication of a boy who'd never fit into her world.

That's what you did when you cared about someone, Lucas thought. You let them go when keeping them would cost too much.

Even if letting go cost everything.
