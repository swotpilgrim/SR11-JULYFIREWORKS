# Chapter 22: Empty Victory

The week before Fourth of July became a blur of final preparations and relentless efficiency.

I threw myself into celebration planning with mechanical precision. Confirmed vendor schedules. Inspected stage setup for the third time. Reviewed fireworks timing down to the second. Coordinated volunteer shifts. Triple-checked the sound system.

Everything was perfect. Everything was exactly as it should be.

I felt nothing.

Monday morning, I met with the fireworks company to finalize the display. They'd created something spectacular—cascading fountains of red, white, and blue, finale shells that would light up the entire bay, patriotic patterns exploding across the night sky.

"It'll be the best show Liberty Beach has ever seen," the technician promised. "Your father's going to love it."

Of course he would. It was his campaign showcase, his redemption. The celebration I'd organized would prove to everyone that the Morrison family was united, appropriate, and worthy of continued leadership.

Tuesday, I supervised the decoration installation. Miles of bunting in patriotic colors. Flags on every lamppost. The wooden stage painted and polished. The gazebo draped in stars and stripes. Town Square transformed into a picture-perfect vision of American celebration.

Mrs. Henderson stood beside me, checking off her list. "This is going to be magnificent, Katherine. The campaign couldn't ask for better optics."

Optics. Always optics.

Wednesday brought the dress rehearsal. Father practiced his speech on the empty stage while I stood beside him where I'd stand on the actual day. His speechwriter had crafted something powerful about family values, traditional American principles, and the importance of strong leadership in uncertain times.

I listened to him rehearse the opening—references to the Founding Fathers, to liberty and independence, to the American spirit of determination. Then the pivot to local concerns, his eight years of accomplishments, his vision for Liberty Beach's future. The promises about continued growth and stability.

And then the personal moment.

"And I want to thank my daughter, Katherine," Father said, gesturing to where I stood, "who has organized this wonderful celebration and represents the very best of Liberty Beach's young people. She embodies the values we hold dear—dedication, responsibility, commitment to community. She is the future of our town."

Scattered applause from the campaign volunteers who'd gathered to watch. I smiled and waved on cue, exactly as I'd been instructed.

The puppet performing her role.

"Perfect," Father said, coming off stage. "You're a natural, Kate. Just like that on the Fourth, and we'll have them eating out of our hands." He looked genuinely pleased. "The Caldwell campaign won't know what hit them."

A natural performer. Just what every girl dreams of becoming.

Mr. Henderson approached with his clipboard. "Katherine, I want to review your positioning. You'll stand slightly behind and to the left of your father during the main speech. When he mentions you, step forward, wave, then return to position. During the finale, you'll stand beside him for the photographs. Simple, clean, effective."

Simple. Clean. Effective. Political theater reduced to blocking and marks.

We rehearsed it three more times until Mr. Henderson was satisfied. Each time, I hit my marks perfectly. Each time, my smile looked genuine. Each time, I became a little less real.

That afternoon, Mother insisted we go shopping for my Fourth of July outfit. Not the pink dress this time—something different, more festive, more patriotic.

We found it at Patterson's: a white dress with a red belt and blue accents. Very Americana, very appropriate for standing onstage beside the mayor. Mother also purchased a red headband and white gloves.

"You'll look like the spirit of Liberty itself," she said with satisfaction. "The newspapers will love it."

Of course they would. That was the point.

Wednesday evening, David called to confirm his plans for the Fourth. He'd arrive early, escort me through the celebration, stand prominently in the crowd during Father's speech. More photo opportunities. More proof of appropriate relationships.

"I'm looking forward to it," he said. "Should be a great day."

"Should be," I echoed.

After dinner, I sat in my room supposedly resting but actually staring out the window toward the bay. Somewhere out there was the old pier. Lucas's refuge. Our place.

Father hadn't had it demolished yet. Maybe he'd forgotten in the rush of campaign recovery. Or maybe he was saving it as a reminder of what happened when people crossed political lines.

I wondered if Lucas still went there. Probably not. Why torture himself with memories of something that couldn't last?

I wondered if he thought about me.

I wondered if he'd be in the crowd on the Fourth, watching me stand onstage beside Father, final proof that the mayor's daughter knew her place.

Probably. Everyone would be there. The biggest event of the summer, and I'd organized every detail of it. My triumph. My empty victory.

Thursday, the day before the celebration, brought last-minute emergencies that would have sent most organizers into panic. But not me. I'd been trained too well for that.

First crisis: The ice cream vendor canceled—his truck broke down two counties away and couldn't be repaired in time. I found a replacement within thirty minutes.

Second crisis: The sound system developed feedback during testing. I called in a different technician who traced the problem to a loose connection.

Third crisis: The children's parade was scheduled to overlap with Father's speech. I reworked the entire afternoon timeline, shifting everything by fifteen minutes without disrupting any other events.

Each problem that arose, I solved. Calmly, efficiently, without visible stress. The perfect organizer, the perfect daughter, handling pressure with grace.

"You're amazing, Katherine," Mrs. Henderson said after I'd resolved the parade timing conflict with a simple phone call. "So organized, so unflappable. Your father must be so proud."

Proud of my ability to perform under pressure. Proud of my return to appropriate behavior. Proud of the campaign asset I'd become again.

"I just want everything to be perfect for him," I said, and meant it. Not because I cared about his campaign, but because perfection was all I had left. If I couldn't be authentic, I could at least be flawlessly appropriate.

By Thursday evening, every detail was locked down. The schedule was airtight. The backup plans had backup plans. Nothing could go wrong.

I'd organized the perfect celebration for my father's campaign. The only thing imperfect was how I felt about it.

That evening, the Morrison family had a private dinner—just the three of us, celebrating in advance the triumph tomorrow would bring.

Father raised his glass of wine. "To Katherine, whose hard work has made tomorrow possible. And whose maturity through recent difficulties has made her mother and me very proud."

We clinked glasses. I drank my water—sixteen was too young for wine, even in celebration—and felt the weight of their approval pressing down on me.

I was doing everything right. Being everything they needed. The perfect daughter was back, and all was right with their world.

So why did I feel like I was disappearing?

After dinner, I helped Mother with the dishes—a rare occurrence in our house, but she wanted this night to feel special, family-oriented. We worked in comfortable silence, her washing, me drying.

"I know this has been hard," Mother said suddenly. "These past few weeks. The situation with that boy."

I focused on the plate in my hands. "It's fine. I understand now."

"Do you?" Mother looked at me with something almost like concern. "Or are you just saying what you think we want to hear?"

The question surprised me. When was the last time Mother cared about what I actually thought versus what I said?

"I'm saying I understand my responsibilities," I answered carefully. "To the family. To Father's campaign. To my future."

Mother was quiet for a moment. "Sometimes I wonder if we asked too much of you. If we should have let you just be a teenage girl instead of the mayor's daughter."

I glanced at her, startled. Was this regret I heard in her voice?

"But then I remember what's at stake," Mother continued, drying her hands. "Your father's work, our position, your opportunities. And I know we made the right choices. Even if they weren't easy."

The moment of vulnerability passed. Mother was back to justifications, back to the party line. We'd made the right choices. Everything was as it should be.

I finished the dishes and went to bed early. Tomorrow would be a long day—the celebration started at ten in the morning and wouldn't end until the fireworks finale after dark. Twelve hours of performance, culminating in standing onstage beside Father while he declared victory over scandal and opposition alike.

I should feel triumphant. I'd organized a spectacular celebration. I'd returned to appropriate behavior. I'd proven myself mature and dutiful.

I felt hollow.

That night, I dreamed of the old pier. Lucas and I sitting on weathered wood, watching seagulls, talking about nothing and everything. In the dream, we could stay there forever. Time had stopped. The real world couldn't reach us.

I woke before dawn, disoriented. For a moment, I couldn't remember where I was—my bedroom on Beach Hill or the old pier by the bay.

Reality settled in. My bedroom. The Fourth of July. Performance day.

I lay in the pre-dawn darkness and thought about Lucas's words when he'd released me: "It was the realest thing in my life."

Mine too.

And tomorrow—today—I would stand onstage and prove that real things didn't matter as much as appropriate things. That authenticity was less important than reputation. That being yourself was a luxury the mayor's daughter couldn't afford.

Everyone would nod approvingly. The town would celebrate. The campaign would triumph.

And I would play my part perfectly, just like I'd been trained.

The perfect daughter in the perfect celebration, feeling perfectly empty inside.

Victory, they'd call it.

It didn't feel like victory.

It felt like surrender.
