# Chapter 7: Second Chance

The campaign tea at Mrs. Henderson's house was exactly as tedious as I'd expected.

Twelve ladies in summer dresses and hats, sipping iced tea from crystal glasses, discussing my father's infrastructure accomplishments and Robert Caldwell's lack of experience. Mother presided over the gathering with gracious efficiency, steering conversations toward favorable topics, deflecting anything controversial.

I sat on a wicker chair in Mrs. Henderson's garden, smiling and nodding and saying appropriate things. The perfect daughter, on display once again.

But my mind was at the docks.

I'd decided three days ago to find Lucas and apologize. Since then, I'd been looking for the right opportunity—a moment when I could slip away without Mother noticing, without causing questions, without creating the kind of speculation that would reach my father's ears.

Mrs. Henderson launched into a monologue about proper landscaping reflecting community values. Mrs. Thompson nodded enthusiastically. Mother added something about maintaining standards.

I set down my tea glass and stood.

"Excuse me," I said quietly to Mother. "I need to check on something for the Fourth of July committee. Mrs. Patterson was supposed to confirm the bunting order today."

Mother's eyes narrowed slightly—she knew I was making an excuse—but she couldn't call me out in front of the other ladies without making a scene.

"Don't be long, Katherine," she said, her pleasant tone carrying a warning.

"I won't be."

I walked out of Mrs. Henderson's perfect garden, past her perfect roses, down her perfect street. The afternoon sun beat down warm on my shoulders. Summer had settled over Liberty Beach like a comfortable blanket—hot but not oppressive, lazy afternoons stretching toward long twilight evenings.

I should have gone to check on the bunting order. Should have done exactly what I'd said.

Instead, I walked toward the docks.

My heart hammered against my ribs. This was reckless. If Mother found out, if someone saw me, if word got back to Father—

But I kept walking anyway.

Because I couldn't keep living with that resigned look in Lucas's eyes. Couldn't keep seeing myself as the coward who'd stood silent while her father insulted someone who'd shown her kindness.

Couldn't keep performing perfect Kate when I'd forgotten what real Kate even felt like.

Wade's Garage sat on the corner near the working waterfront, a squat building with peeling paint and a hand-lettered sign. The big garage door stood open, revealing a car up on the lift and tools scattered across a workbench. The smell of motor oil and metal hung in the warm air.

Lucas wasn't inside the garage. He was sitting on a wooden pylon at the dock's edge, twenty feet away, watching fishing boats unload their afternoon catch.

I stopped, suddenly uncertain. What was I doing here? What would I even say?

He must have sensed movement because he turned, and our eyes met.

For a second, neither of us moved.

Then Lucas's expression closed, walls going up. "Mayor's daughter slumming at the docks? That's a new campaign strategy."

The words stung, but I deserved them.

"Can I talk to you?" I asked quietly.

"Depends. Is your mother about to appear and dismiss me again? Is your father going to lecture me about wasted potential?"

"No. I'm alone." I took a hesitant step forward. "And I'm sorry. For last week. For not saying anything when my father was awful to you. For letting my mother dismiss you like you didn't matter."

Lucas studied me warily. "You practiced that speech?"

"No." I moved closer, standing a few feet from his pylon. "I've been trying to figure out what to say for days, but I didn't rehearse anything. This is just... me. Being honest. Finally."

His walls didn't come down, but something in his expression shifted slightly. "Why?"

"Because you were right. About people like me always performing. About me not speaking up." I twisted my hands together. "I opened my mouth to defend you. I actually started to say something. And then I stopped because sixteen years of training kicked in. Don't contradict Father. Don't make scenes. Don't cause problems for the campaign."

"So you stayed silent."

"So I stayed silent." The admission hurt. "And you weren't even surprised. You looked resigned, like you'd expected exactly that from me. And you were right to expect it, because that's what I did."

Lucas watched me, expression unreadable. "Kate—"

"I'm not looking for forgiveness," I interrupted. "I just needed you to know I'm sorry. You helped me when my supplies went everywhere. You talked to me like I was an actual person instead of a political prop. And I repaid that by proving you right about the mayor's daughter being exactly what everyone thinks she is."

"Which is?"

"Shallow. Performed. More concerned with appearances than truth."

"I never said shallow."

"You didn't have to." I looked down at my hands. "I've been thinking about what you said. About everyone being so busy being who they're supposed to be that they forget how to just be. And you're right. I've been performing so long I don't know who I actually am underneath."

The fishing boat engines rumbled in the background. Seagulls wheeled overhead, crying out. The dock smelled like salt and fish and summer.

Lucas slid off the pylon, landing lightly on the weathered planks. He was close now, close enough that I could see the scar through his eyebrow, the careful intelligence in his dark eyes.

"You want to know something?" he said quietly. "I expected you to stay silent. But I was still hoping you wouldn't."

"I disappointed you."

"You disappointed yourself." He tilted his head, studying me. "That's why you're here, isn't it? Not because I'm mad at you, but because you're mad at yourself."

He saw too much. Always saw too much.

"Maybe," I admitted.

"Well." Lucas leaned against the pylon. "I accept your apology. For what it's worth."

Relief flooded through me. "Really?"

"Yeah. I get it—you're trapped in a role you didn't choose. Your family has expectations. The whole town watches everything you do. Speaking up would have caused problems you can't afford."

"That doesn't make it right."

"No," he agreed. "But it makes it understandable."

We stood there in the afternoon sunlight, and I realized I didn't want to leave yet. Didn't want to go back to Mrs. Henderson's perfect garden and my mother's perfect tea and my perfect daughter performance.

"Can I ask you something?" I said.

"Sure."

"What are you reading now?"

Lucas's eyebrows went up. "That's what you want to ask?"

"You told me you were reading Kerouac. 'On the Road.' I've been thinking about that. About what you said—breaking free from expectations and finding yourself through movement."

Something like surprise crossed his face. Then his mouth quirked into an almost-smile.

"Yeah. Still reading it. Just finished the section where Sal and Dean drive across the country for the third time, chasing something they can't quite name."

"What are they chasing?"

"Freedom, maybe. Or authenticity. Or just the feeling of being alive instead of going through prescribed motions." Lucas pulled the paperback from his jacket pocket. "They keep moving because stopping means settling into the kind of conventional life that feels like death."

"Sounds exhausting."

"Sounds necessary." He looked at me directly. "If you're suffocating in the life everyone says you should want."

There it was again—that sense that we weren't talking about the book anymore.

"Are you?" I asked quietly. "Suffocating?"

"Every day." No hesitation, just blunt honesty. "Everyone in this town decided who I am when I was fourteen. Troublemaker. Wasted potential. Headed nowhere. And I'm tired of fighting it, so I just... gave them what they expected."

"But you're not what they think."

"No. But trying to prove that hurts more than accepting it." He kicked at a loose board on the dock. "Easier to be the troublemaker than to keep hoping people might see something else."

"I see something else," I said before I could stop myself.

Lucas's eyes snapped to mine. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. I see someone who reads philosophy and builds motorcycles from scrap and thinks about alienation and authenticity. Someone intelligent and perceptive who helped a stranger pick up her dropped supplies and made her laugh." I took a breath. "Someone who sees through performances to something real."

"Kate—"

"I should go." The words came out rushed. "My mother will notice I've been gone too long, and I told her I was checking on bunting orders, and—"

"Kate." Lucas's voice was gentle. "You don't have to explain. I know you can't just stand here talking to me. I know what it would mean if someone saw us."

"I wish it didn't have to be that way."

"Yeah. Me too." He hesitated, then said carefully, "You could come back. If you wanted. I'm here most afternoons, working on engines or just sitting. If you needed to talk about books or campaigns or... whatever."

My heart did something complicated. "That would be reckless."

"Probably."

"People would talk."

"Definitely."

"My father would kill me."

"Most likely."

Despite everything, I smiled. "When did you get so funny?"

"I've always been funny. You just never stuck around long enough to notice." Lucas's expression turned serious. "But I mean it. If you want to talk—about Camus or Kerouac or how exhausting it is to be perfect—I'm here. No performance required. Just honest conversation."

I wanted to say yes immediately. Wanted to promise I'd come back tomorrow and the next day and every day after.

But reality intruded, the way it always did.

"I'll try," I said finally. "I can't promise when, or how often. But if I can slip away—"

"Then you know where to find me."

I started to leave, then turned back. "Lucas? Thank you. For accepting my apology. And for the invitation. And for seeing me as Kate instead of just as the mayor's daughter."

"Easy." His eyes held mine. "Kate's a lot more interesting than the perfect daughter act."

The words wrapped around my heart and held on.

I walked back toward Mrs. Henderson's garden, toward my mother's expectations and my role as campaign prop. But something inside me felt lighter.

I'd apologized. I'd been honest. I'd had a real conversation.

And Lucas had invited me back.

The mayor's daughter probably shouldn't take him up on that invitation.

But Kate—just Kate, whoever she was underneath the performance—wanted desperately to return.

And for the first time in years, maybe ever, I was starting to think Kate's wants might matter as much as everyone else's expectations.

Even if I had no idea what to do with that dangerous thought.
