# Chapter 17: Performance Required

The next morning, Mother appeared in my doorway before I'd even finished dressing. She carried a garment bag and wore that determined expression I'd learned to dread—the one that meant she'd already planned everything.

"We need to talk about the dance," she said, laying the bag across my bed. "I've coordinated everything with Virginia Hartwell. You and David arrive at seven-thirty. The photographer will be there at eight."

I stood by my dresser in my slip, feeling exposed. "Mother—"

"The Caldwell campaign has been spreading rumors," she continued, ignoring me. "Suggesting we can't manage our own family. This dance is our opportunity to show everyone that everything is perfectly fine." She unzipped the bag. "I picked this up from Patterson's yesterday."

The dress was pale pink, modest neckline, full skirt. Exactly the sort of thing the mayor's perfect daughter would wear. I used to have opinions about my clothes, I thought distantly. Before I learned that everything was a message, a strategy, a performance.

"It's lovely," I said automatically.

Mother smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. The scandal had aged her. "I know this has been difficult. But you're doing the right thing."

Would I? Or would I spend my life doing the right thing, wearing the right dresses, being the right daughter?

"David's mother and I thought you might wear your pearls," Mother continued, moving to my jewelry box. "And perhaps the blue cardigan your grandmother gave you. Very classic. Very appropriate."

Appropriate. That word again. The measuring stick against which every choice was judged.

"Your father told me about your conversation last night," Mother said quietly, not looking at me. Her hands moved through my jewelry with practiced efficiency. "I know you think we're being unfair. Cruel, even."

I stayed silent.

"But we're protecting you. You don't understand yet how one mistake can follow you forever." She turned to face me, holding the pearls. "I was seventeen when I met your father. Dating someone else my parents didn't approve of. They made me end it. I was furious."

I'd never heard this story.

"Two years later, that boy went to prison for embezzlement." Mother's voice was matter-of-fact. "If I'd married him, my life would have been entirely different." She held out the pearls. "Sometimes parents see things their children can't."

"Lucas isn't a criminal," I said.

"No, but he's trouble. And trouble has a way of spreading." Mother fastened the pearls around my neck, her fingers cool against my skin. "Your father has worked so hard to build our position in this town. Everything we have—this house, your education, your opportunities—it all depends on his reputation. On our family's reputation."

"So I have to pretend to be someone I'm not?"

"You have to be who you are," Mother said firmly. "The mayor's daughter. It's not pretending, Kate. It's understanding your place in the world."

But what if I didn't want that place? What if I wanted to choose my own place, make my own way, be my own person?

I didn't say it out loud. There wasn't any point.

Mother spent the next twenty minutes directing me through my transformation. The pink dress fit perfectly—of course it did. Mother had excellent taste. The pearls gleamed against my throat. The blue cardigan completed the picture of innocent, wholesome, appropriate young womanhood.

I looked in the mirror and saw a stranger. Or maybe I saw exactly who I'd always been and was just now admitting it.

"Beautiful," Mother said, satisfaction in her voice. "David will call at noon to confirm the arrangements. He's very understanding about all this, Kate. Very mature. The Hartwells are good people."

Bland people, I thought. Safe people. The kind of people who never made waves or caused problems or felt anything strongly enough to risk reputation for it.

After Mother left, I sat on my bed in my perfect pink dress and felt the walls closing in. The dance was tomorrow night. I had less than thirty-six hours before I'd have to stand in front of Liberty Beach and smile while my photograph was taken with David Hartwell, officially ending whatever brief thing I'd had with Lucas.

The telephone rang downstairs. I heard Mother answer, her voice bright and gracious. Probably a campaign volunteer or one of her committee ladies.

A knock on my door. "Kate? Jennifer's here to see you."

Jen bounded in, then stopped short when she saw my dress. "Oh. Is that for the dance?"

I nodded.

She sat beside me, tucking her legs under her. Jen had been my best friend since third grade. She knew me better than anyone except maybe Lucas, though differently. Jen knew all my performances, all my masks.

"Are you okay?" she asked quietly.

"I'm fine," I said automatically. Then, because it was Jen and she could always tell when I was lying, "No. I'm not fine. But I don't have a choice."

"Maybe it's for the best," Jen said gently. "I mean, Lucas is exciting and all. But Kate, you have to think about your future. College, your reputation, your family." She took my hand. "David's a good guy. He'd never put you in a position like this."

"Because David never makes me feel anything," I said before I could stop myself.

Jen looked confused. "What do you mean?"

How could I explain? Jen was happy with Tommy. She wanted exactly the life planned for her.

"Lucas makes me feel real," I tried. "Like I don't have to think about every word or what people will think. I can just be myself."

"But Kate, you are yourself," Jen protested. "This is you. The mayor's daughter, student council secretary, the girl who organizes the Fourth of July celebration. That's who you are."

Was it? Or was it just who I'd been trained to be?

"Maybe you're right," I said, because arguing with Jen about this was pointless. She was trying to help in the only way she knew how. "Maybe it's just excitement. Summer romance that was never meant to last."

Jen brightened. "Exactly! And in the fall, you'll go to school dances with David, and everything will be back to normal. You'll see—in a few months, you won't even remember why Lucas seemed so important."

That's what terrified me. Not that I might forget Lucas, but that I might forget the Kate who'd existed with him. The girl who'd laughed at the old pier, who'd discovered preferences and opinions and a voice of her own. What if I really did forget her? What if I buried her so deep she disappeared entirely?

"The dance will be fun," Jen continued, trying to cheer me up. "The decorations are beautiful—red, white, and blue everywhere. Very patriotic. And the band they hired is supposed to be really keen. Tommy's picking me up at seven. Maybe we can all go to McCarthy's afterward for milkshakes."

The four of us. Me and David, Jen and Tommy. Two perfect couples doing perfectly appropriate things.

I wanted to scream.

Instead, I smiled. "That sounds swell."

Jen stayed another hour, chattering about the dance and Tommy. I half-listened, making appropriate responses, performing friendship the way I performed everything.

After she left, I stood at my window looking out at Beach Hill. Somewhere out there was Lucas, probably working at his father's garage, not knowing yet what choice I'd made. Or maybe he did know. Maybe he'd seen this coming—the mayor's daughter returning to her proper place.

The telephone rang again. This time, Mother called up that it was for me.

I picked up the extension in the hallway. "Hello?"

"Kate, hi, it's David." His voice was pleasant, friendly, utterly unsurprising. "I wanted to confirm tomorrow. I'll pick you up at seven-thirty? My mother suggested we might want to arrive a bit early for photographs."

"Seven-thirty is fine," I said.

"Great. I'm really looking forward to it." He paused. "I know things have been kind of weird lately. But I'm glad we're doing this. I think it'll be nice."

Nice. Everything with David was nice. Nice and safe and pleasant and completely devoid of any real feeling.

"Me too," I lied.

We talked for a few more minutes about logistics—corsages and photos and after-party plans. David had it all organized. We were well-matched in that way. Both of us perfectly trained to be who we were supposed to be.

After I hung up, I carefully hung the pink dress in my closet. Tomorrow night I'd put it on and show Liberty Beach that Katherine Morrison had come to her senses.

I sat at my desk and pulled out stationery. I should write to Lucas. Explain why I couldn't see him anymore. Make him understand it wasn't about not caring.

I picked up my pen. Put it down. Picked it up again.

What could I possibly say? I'm sorry, but I'm not brave enough to fight for us?

The blank page mocked me.

Finally, I put the stationery away. There was nothing to say that wouldn't sound like an excuse.

I lay back on my bed in my perfect pink dress and stared at the ceiling.

Tomorrow night I'd go to the dance with David Hartwell. I'd smile for the cameras and be gracious to everyone. I'd show Liberty Beach that the scandal was over, that I'd returned to being the daughter I was supposed to be.

And somewhere out there, Lucas would see the photograph in the paper and understand that I'd chosen my family over him. My reputation over authenticity. Safety over truth.

He'd understand because he'd always known it would end this way. People like me didn't end up with people like him. That's just how the world worked.

The dress hung in my closet, pale pink and perfect, waiting to complete my transformation back into the mayor's daughter.

Only two more days until the dance. Two more days until I officially became who I'd always been destined to be.

The performance of a lifetime.
