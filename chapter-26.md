# Chapter 26: The Choice

We danced for three songs before the whispers grew too loud to ignore.

Everyone was watching. Campaign volunteers,town gossips, families who'd come for a wholesome Fourth of July celebration. All of them staring at the mayor's daughter dancing with Lucas Wade after walking away from her father's speech.

I should have been mortified. A week ago, I would have been.

But standing in Lucas's arms, swaying to music while the sun set over Liberty Beach, I felt something I hadn't felt in years: peace.

"They're all staring," Lucas murmured.

"I know."

"Your father looks like he wants to kill me."

I glanced toward the stage where Father had resumed his speech, though the energy was completely different now. Subdued. Awkward. The campaign moment ruined.

"He'll survive," I said.

"Will you?" Lucas pulled back slightly to look at me. "Kate, I need you to be sure. Really sure. Because once you do this—once you choose this publicly—there's no taking it back. The town won't forget. Your parents won't forget."

"I know."

"Your father could still destroy my family's business. Make life impossible for us. Use every bit of his political power to punish—"

I put my finger on his lips, stopping the words. "Lucas. I'm choosing you. Not to hurt my father or rebel against my parents or make some grand gesture. I'm choosing you because you're the only person who sees me as Kate instead of Katherine Morrison, Political Asset. You're choosing you because with you, I don't have to perform."

"But the cost—"

"Is worth it." I said it firmly, certainly. "Whatever happens next—angry parents, scandal, social consequences—it's worth it to finally be real."

Lucas searched my face, looking for doubt or hesitation. I met his gaze steadily.

"Okay," he said finally. "Then I'm choosing you too. Publicly. Completely. Even though it's going to make everything complicated."

"Especially because it's going to make everything complicated," I said with a small smile. "Nothing worth having comes easy, right?"

He laughed—genuine, unguarded. "Who taught you that? Because it definitely wasn't your campaign manager father."

"A very wise troublemaker I met at the old pier," I teased.

The song ended. Around us, other couples continued dancing, but I could feel eyes on us. Particularly Mrs. Miller, who was practically vibrating with the gossip potential of this moment.

"We should probably face the music," Lucas said. "Literally. The fireworks start in an hour, and your father looks like he wants to have that conversation you promised him."

He was right. Father had finished his speech—abbreviated, awkward, but finished—and was now standing with Mother and Mr. Henderson, all three watching us with varying expressions of displeasure.

"Ready?" I asked Lucas.

"Absolutely not," he admitted. "But let's do it anyway."

Hand in hand, we walked toward my parents. The crowd parted—not quite hostile, but definitely judging. I heard whispers as we passed:

"Can you believe her?"

"After all that work getting back with David Hartwell—"

"The mayor must be furious—"

"That poor family—"

Let them whisper. For once in my life, what they thought mattered less than what I knew to be true.

Father saw us coming and straightened, politician's mask sliding into place. But I could see the anger beneath it.

"Kate," he said when we reached him. "Lucas. I think we need to have a family discussion."

"I'm not family," Lucas said quietly.

"No, but you're involved in this situation." Father's tone was careful, controlled. This was campaign face, the one he used when managing difficult constituencies. "Tom, would you join us as well?"

Lucas's father had been standing at a distance, watching warily. He approached now, jaw set.

Father gestured to a quiet area behind the vendor booths. Away from the crowd, away from Mrs. Miller's eager ears. A private space for public drama.

We gathered there—my parents, Lucas and his father, and me. An unlikely summit.

"First," Father said, looking at Tom Wade, "I apologize for the building inspector situation. That was an abuse of my position, and it won't happen again. I'll personally ensure those citations are reviewed fairly."

Tom Wade looked stunned. "You're... apologizing?"

"I am." Father's voice was stiff, but sincere. "My daughter's right—innocent people shouldn't have been involved. Your business shouldn't be collateral damage in a political campaign."

It wasn't a full confession. Wasn't admitting he'd sent the inspectors deliberately. But it was close enough that everyone understood.

"Thank you," Tom said carefully.

Father turned to me. "Kate. I'm not going to lie—what you did today humiliated me professionally and personally. You destroyed a major campaign moment, created a public spectacle, and showed profound disrespect for everything your mother and I have tried to teach you."

I braced myself.

"But," Father continued, and something in his voice shifted, "you also showed courage. Real courage. Standing up for what you believe in, even when it costs you. Even when everyone's watching and judging. That's... that's not nothing."

I stared at him, shocked.

Mother made a small noise of protest, but Father held up his hand. "Eleanor, let me finish." He looked at me again. "I've spent eight years in politics. I know how to read a room, how to judge what people really think versus what they say. And Kate, when you walked away from that stage and went to Lucas... there was conviction in that choice. Real belief."

"Richard," Mother said warningly.

"I'm not saying I approve," Father clarified quickly. "I don't. You're sixteen, Kate. You're too young to make permanent life decisions based on summer romance. Lucas is a nice enough young man, but he's not—"

"Appropriate for the mayor's daughter," Lucas finished dryly.

Father had the grace to look uncomfortable. "I was going to say 'in the same social circle,' but yes. There are practical considerations. Social realities that exist whether we like them or not."

"Then change them," I said. "You're the mayor. You have influence. Use it to make Liberty Beach a place where people aren't judged by which side of the tracks they're from."

Father actually laughed, though there was no humor in it. "Katie, it's not that simple—"

"Why not?" I pressed. "You changed things when you fought for the new school, for infrastructure improvements, for tourism development. You fought for what you thought mattered. Well, this matters. People being judged for who they are, not who their parents are. That matters."

Father was quiet for a long moment. Then he sighed. "You're idealistic. That's both admirable and frustrating."

"I learned it from watching you fight for what you believed in," I pointed out. "You taught me that some things are worth standing up for."

"I taught you to pick your battles wisely," Father countered. "To understand consequences before acting."

"I understand the consequences," I said firmly. "Scandal. Social disapproval. Damage to your campaign. Maybe not getting into my first-choice college because my reputation is tarnished. I understand all of it. And I'm choosing this anyway."

Mother finally spoke up, voice tight. "Kate, you're throwing away your future—"

"No," I interrupted gently. "I'm claiming my future. There's a difference."

We stood in tense silence. Around us, the celebration continued—music, laughter, the normal sounds of Fourth of July. But in our small circle, everything hung in balance.

"I can't support this," Father said finally. "Not publicly. My campaign can't afford to look like I condone my sixteen-year-old daughter dating someone I've spent months using as a negative example."

"I understand," I said, even though it hurt.

"But," Father continued, meeting my eyes, "I also can't force you to be someone you're not. I've tried that. Clearly it doesn't work." He glanced at Mother. "We need to let Kate make her own choices. Even the ones we disagree with."

Mother looked like she might argue, but something in Father's expression stopped her.

"However," Father added, looking at Lucas, "there will be conditions. Kate is still sixteen. She still lives in my house, follows my rules. No unchaperoned dates. Reasonable curfew. School remains the priority. And Lucas—"

"Sir?" Lucas straightened.

"If you hurt my daughter, if you take advantage of this situation, if you give me any reason to believe you're not treating her with respect—well, I may have apologized for the building inspector situation, but I have other tools at my disposal."

It was a threat wrapped in fatherly concern. But there was something almost protective in Father's tone, like he was grudgingly accepting that this was happening and trying to maintain some control.

"I understand, sir," Lucas said seriously. "I care about Kate. I won't hurt her."

"See that you don't."

Tom Wade cleared his throat. "For what it's worth, Mayor Morrison, my son's a good kid. Gets in trouble sometimes, has a reputation, but he's got honor. He'll treat your daughter right."

Father nodded stiffly. "I hope so."

"We should get back," Father said. "People will wonder where we've gone." He looked at me. "Kate, we're having many more conversations about this. Tonight, tomorrow, next week. This isn't resolved."

"I know."

"And your mother and I reserve the right to change our minds if this becomes destructive."

"I understand."

Father offered his arm to Mother. They walked back toward the stage together, a united front despite everything.

Tom Wade clapped Lucas on the shoulder. "Well, son, you've certainly made life interesting."

"Sorry, Dad."

"Don't be. The Morrison girl's got spine. I respect that." He headed back toward the crowd.

Lucas and I stood alone.

"So," he said. "That happened."

"That happened," I agreed.

"Your father still hates me."

"He'll come around. Eventually."

Lucas pulled me close. "Was it worth it? All of this?"

I thought about the cost—Father's ruined speech, Mother's disappointment, the scandal ahead.

And I thought about the alternative—standing on that stage, performing perfection, slowly disappearing into the role everyone needed me to play.

"Yes," I said certainly. "Absolutely yes."

He smiled. "Good. Because there's no going back now."

"I know." I took his hand. "Let's watch the fireworks."

Together, we walked back toward the celebration. Toward my family. Toward the town gossip. Toward a future I'd chosen instead of one chosen for me.

For the first time in sixteen years, I was just Kate Morrison.

Just Kate.

Finally me.
