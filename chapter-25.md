# Chapter 25: Seeing Lucas

The moment stretched impossibly long—Lucas and me standing at the crowd's edge, hands clasped, while hundreds of people watched in stunned silence.

Then reality crashed back in.

"Katherine!" Mother's voice cut through the shocked murmurs. She'd reached us, face flushed, eyes blazing with fury and panic. "What do you think you're doing?"

I turned to face her, still holding Lucas's hand. "I'm being myself. Finally."

"You're being selfish!" Mother hissed, trying to keep her voice down but failing. "Your father is standing on that stage—"

"I know where Father is." My voice was steadier than I felt. "And I know what he expected me to do. But I can't, Mother. I can't go up there and pretend anymore."

People were definitely watching now. The mayor's daughter and her mother, having it out at the edge of the celebration. This would be the talk of Liberty Beach for years.

I didn't care.

Mother's expression shifted from fury to something almost like desperation. "Kate, please. Think about what you're doing. Your future, your reputation, everything we've worked for—"

"Everything you've worked for," I corrected gently but firmly. "Not me. I never got to choose any of it."

"You're sixteen! You don't know what you want!"

"Maybe not everything," I admitted. "But I know I don't want to spend my life performing who you need me to be instead of discovering who I actually am."

Mother looked at Lucas like he was a snake. "This is your fault. You put these ideas in her head—"

"He didn't put anything in my head," I interrupted. "He just saw me. The real me. And that made me realize how long I'd been hiding."

On the stage, I could see Father conferring with Mr. Henderson. The speech had completely derailed. Campaign volunteers were trying to manage the crowd, to restore some semblance of order.

I'd destroyed his perfect moment. His campaign showcase had become a spectacle, but not the kind he'd planned.

Part of me felt guilty. But a larger part felt free.

Mother took a deep breath, visibly trying to regain composure. "Kate. Sweetheart. I understand you're confused. These teenage feelings can be very strong. But please, come with me. We'll go backstage, we'll fix your hair, and you can still appear with your father. We can salvage this."

"There's nothing to salvage," I said quietly. "I'm not going up there, Mother. Not today. Not to stand beside Father and prove that I've been brought back under control."

"But you have responsibilities—"

"To myself," I finished. "I have responsibilities to myself. To be honest. To be real. To choose my own path."

Mother looked at me like she didn't recognize me. Maybe she didn't. Maybe I'd been performing so long that this version of Kate—the one who spoke her mind and made her own choices—was a stranger to her.

Maybe it was a stranger to me too. But I was ready to get to know her.

David had finally worked his way through the crowd. He looked thoroughly bewildered. "Kate? What's going on? Your father's speech—"

"I know, David. I'm sorry." And I was sorry, in a way. Sorry for the confusion, for the awkwardness. But not sorry for my choice. "I can't do this. I can't stand up there and pretend we're something we're not."

"But we're—I thought—" David stumbled over words, trying to understand. "Did I do something wrong?"

"No," I said truthfully. "You're exactly who you're supposed to be. That's the problem. I'm tired of being who I'm supposed to be instead of who I am."

Jen pushed through with Tommy, eyes wide. "Kate! Everyone's saying you walked away from your father's speech! Is it true?"

"It's true."

Jen looked between me and Lucas, our joined hands, and understanding dawned. "You're choosing him. Even after everything—the dances, the photographs, getting back on track—you're choosing Lucas Wade."

"I'm choosing myself," I corrected. "Lucas is just the only person who actually let me be myself."

Lucas squeezed my hand. He hadn't said much, but his presence beside me felt solid. Real.Anchor in the storm I'd created.

The crowd was buzzing now, conversations spreading like wildfire. Mrs. Miller would have enough gossip to last a decade. Campaign volunteers looked panicked. My father's perfect Fourth of July celebration was dissolving into chaos.

And somehow, standing in the middle of that chaos, I felt calmer than I had in weeks.

Because I'd finally stopped trying to control what everyone thought. Stopped calculating appearances and managing reactions. I'd just done what felt true, and whatever happened next would happen.

Father stepped down from the stage. The crowd parted as he walked toward us, face unreadable. This was the moment I'd been dreading—facing his disappointment, his anger, the consequences of my rebellion.

Lucas started to step back, to give us space, but I held his hand tighter. "Stay. Please."

He stayed.

Father reached us. For a long moment, he just looked at me. Then he glanced at our joined hands, at Mother's distraught expression, at the crowd watching this family drama unfold.

"Katie," he said finally, voice carefully controlled. "We need to talk. Privately."

"Whatever you need to say, you can say here," I replied. My voice only shook a little. "I'm done with private conversations where you tell me who to be for political advantage."

Father's jaw tightened. "You've just humiliated me in front of the entire town. In front of voters, in front of the press. You've destroyed my campaign moment—"

"I know." I met his eyes. "I'm sorry for the timing. I'm sorry for the public spectacle. But I'm not sorry for choosing myself."

"Choosing yourself?" Father's control slipped slightly. "You're choosing to throw away your future for a boy you've known three weeks!"

"I'm not throwing away my future. I'm claiming it." I took a deep breath. "Father, I love you. I respect everything you've built. But I can't be your political asset anymore. I can't sublimate my entire identity to your campaign. I'm sixteen years old, and I need to discover who I am—not who you need me to be."

Father looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. Maybe I was. The language of authenticity instead of political strategy.

"And what about my livelihood?" Tom Wade's voice cut through. Lucas's father had appeared, face hard with anger. "My business that's suddenly under inspection because my son talked to your daughter? That what you call discovering who you are—getting innocent people caught in political crossfire?"

Father turned to Tom, and something shifted in his expression. Maybe shame. Maybe realization.

"I'll take care of the building inspector situation," Father said quietly. "That was... that wasn't appropriate. Your business shouldn't have been involved."

Tom Wade stared at him, surprised by the admission.

"But that doesn't mean I approve of this," Father continued, gesturing to me and Lucas. "Kate is sixteen. She's making emotional decisions without thinking about consequences."

"I have thought about consequences," I said. "I know this costs your campaign. I know it damages your image. I know it makes things complicated. But Father—I've spent sixteen years calculating consequences for everyone except myself. And I can't do it anymore. I won't."

The sun was setting now, golden light slanting across Town Square. The celebration was still happening around us—vendors serving food, children playing games, the band setting up for the evening show. Life continuing despite the Morrison family drama.

"What do you want from me, Kate?" Father asked, and for the first time he sounded more tired than angry. "What outcome are you looking for here?"

"I want you to see me," I said simply. "Not as a campaign asset or a political liability. Just as your daughter. Kate. Who's trying to figure out who she is and what she wants. And who needs room to make her own choices, even if they're not the choices you'd make for her."

Father looked at Mother, who'd gone very quiet. Looked at Lucas, who met his gaze steadily. Looked at me, standing there in my patriotic dress, holding hands with the boy he'd threatened to destroy.

"This isn't over," Father said finally. "We're going to talk about this. Really talk. But not here. Not like this."

"I know," I said. "But Father—I need you to understand. I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm trying to save myself."

He studied me for a long moment. Then nodded slowly. "We'll talk. Tonight. After..."He gestured vaguely at the celebration, the chaos, the campaign event that had become a family crisis.

Father turned and walked back toward the stage, shoulders straight despite everything. Mother followed after one last desperate look at me.

David drifted away looking confused. Jen gave me a complicated expression—part concern, part fascination—before Tommy led her back to the crowd.

And then it was just Lucas and me again, standing at the edge of the celebration as the sun set and the evening festivities began.

"You're really doing this," Lucas said wonderingly. "You actually chose."

"I chose," I confirmed. "I chose me. And I chose you. If that's okay."

Lucas pulled me closer, and I could see tears in his eyes. "Kate Morrison, you're the bravest person I've ever met."

"Or the craziest," I said with a shaky laugh.

"Maybe both." He smiled. "Definitely both."

The band started playing. People were dancing, celebrating, moving on from the drama they'd witnessed. Liberty Beach would talk about this for years, but for now, life continued.

Lucas held out his hand. "Want to dance?"

I looked at him—really looked at him. Lucas Wade, the boy who'd helped me find myself. The boy I'd chosen, publicly, dramatically, probably catastrophically.

The boy I wanted to be with, consequences and all.

"Yes," I said. "I want to dance."

And right there, at the edge of the celebration I'd organized, we danced. Not hidden at the old pier. Not secret anymore. Just two people choosing each other, choosing authenticity, choosing truth.

It wasn't perfect. It wasn't appropriate. It wasn't what anyone expected.

But it was real.

And that made all the difference.
