# Chapter 29: Understanding

I woke the next morning to sunlight streaming through my window and the smell of coffee drifting up from the kitchen.

For a moment, I lay in bed disoriented. Then memory crashed back—the celebration, walking away from Father's speech, kissing Lucas during the fireworks, the difficult conversation with my parents.

I'd done it. Really done it. Chosen myself publicly, irreversibly.

Terror and exhilaration warred in my chest.

Downstairs, I heard voices. My parents, talking quietly. I couldn't make out words, but the tone seemed calmer than last night.

I dressed carefully—just jeans and a blouse, nothing special. No performing this morning. Just Kate.

When I came down to the kitchen, Father sat at the table with the Liberty Beach Gazette spread in front of him. Mother stood at the stove, making eggs.

They both looked up when I entered.

"Good morning," I said tentatively.

"Morning," Father replied. He gestured to the paper. "You made the front page."

My stomach dropped. I moved to look over his shoulder.

Sure enough, there it was: a photograph from last night. Lucas and me at the edge of the crowd, clearly visible, caught mid-kiss as fireworks exploded overhead. The headline read: "FOURTH OF JULY SURPRISE: Mayor's Daughter Makes Public Statement."

I read the article quickly. It was surprisingly balanced—not scandalous or condemning, but factual. Described the celebration, Father's speech, my absence from the stage, and my very public kiss with Lucas Wade. The final paragraph noted that the Morrison family was "navigating normal teenage challenges with grace and understanding."

Mr. Henderson's spin, I realized. Damage control in full effect.

"At least they didn't call it a scandal," I said weakly.

"Small mercies," Father agreed. He sipped his coffee. "Sit down, Kate. We need to talk."

I sat, bracing myself for round two of last night's argument.

But Father surprised me.

"I spent most of the night thinking," he said. "About what you said. About who I've become, what I've asked of you." He set down his cup. "And I realized you were right. About most of it."

I stared at him.

"I've been treating you as a campaign asset," Father continued. "Not constantly, not consciously, but enough that it became your primary role. The mayor's dutiful daughter. The proof of family values." He looked directly at me. "That was wrong. And I'm sorry."

Mother set a plate of eggs in front of me but didn't meet my eyes.

"I spent eight years fighting for this town," Father said. "Fighting for improvements, for progress. And somewhere along the way, I forgot that my daughter had rights too. Her own opinions, choices, life." He paused. "Even if those choices make my campaign more difficult."

"Richard—" Mother began.

"No, Eleanor. She's right. We can't control her into being who we want her to be. We can only guide her and hope she makes good decisions." Father looked at me again. "I still don't approve of Lucas Wade. I think you're too young for a serious relationship. I think this will complicate your life unnecessarily."

"But?" I prompted, hearing the unspoken word.

"But I also think you have the right to make that choice. To make your own mistakes and learn from them." Father's mouth quirked slightly. "Even if watching you do it gives me gray hair."

"You already have gray hair," I pointed out.

"More gray hair, then."

Mother finally spoke. "I still think you're being reckless. Throwing away opportunities for a boy you barely know."

"I know," I said gently. "And maybe I am. But Mother, I'd rather be reckless and authentic than careful and hollow."

"You make it sound like those are the only options," Mother said.

"For me, right now, they are. Because I've spent sixteen years being careful. I need to try being real."

Mother sat down with her own coffee, hands wrapped around the mug like she needed the warmth. "Your father and I discussed this until three in the morning. We came to some agreements."

"Agreements?" I asked warily.

Father nodded. "Ground rules. You're still sixteen. You still live in our house. So there will be conditions to this relationship with Lucas."

I'd expected as much. "What conditions?"

"School remains your priority," Father said. "Grades don't slip. Activities continue. College preparation stays on track."

"Agreed."

"No unchaperoned dates until you're seventeen. When you go out with Lucas, you go somewhere public or with other people."

I wanted to argue—we'd spent weeks at the old pier unchaperoned—but I recognized the compromise for what it was. "Agreed."

"Reasonable curfew. Ten on weeknights, eleven on weekends."

"That's fair."

"And Lucas comes to family dinner once a week," Mother added. "If he's going to be part of your life, he needs to be part of our life too. We should know him."

I blinked in surprise. Family dinner meant acceptance. Not approval, maybe, but acknowledgment that this was real.

"He'll come," I promised.

"Also," Father continued, "you'll resume your position with the Fourth of July committee. Next year's celebration won't plan itself."

"You still want me involved in campaign events?" I asked, surprised.

"I want you involved because you're good at it," Father said. "And because you're my daughter, not because I need you for photo opportunities. If you want to help with campaign work, I'd welcome it. But if you'd rather focus on school and your own interests, that's fine too."

This was so different from the Father I'd known—or thought I'd known—that I hardly knew how to respond.

"I'll think about it," I said carefully.

"That's all I ask." Father folded the newspaper. "Kate, I'm not going to pretend this is easy for me. Seeing you with Lucas Wade in that photograph, knowing the town is gossiping, watching my perfect family image crumble—it's difficult. But you were right last night. I've spent years making small compromises until I forgot what I'd compromised. And I don't want to compromise my relationship with my daughter."

Tears stung my eyes. "Thank you, Father."

"Don't thank me yet," he said with a slight smile. "I reserve the right to be overprotective and disapproving. I'm your father. It's my job."

"And I'm your daughter," I said. "It's my job to figure out who I am. Even if that's not who you planned for me to be."

"Especially if it's not who I planned," Father agreed.

Mother was crying softly. I moved to her chair, wrapping my arms around her shoulders.

"I'm still your daughter," I murmured. "That hasn't changed."

"Everything's changed," Mother whispered. "My perfect girl—"

"Was never perfect," I finished gently. "Just performing. This Kate—the one who makes mistakes and defies expectations and chooses her own path—this is the real one. She was always here. I just hid her."

Mother pulled me close, holding on like I might disappear. "Promise me you'll be careful. Promise me you won't throw your life away."

"I promise I'll be thoughtful," I said. "I can't promise I won't make mistakes. But I promise I'll make them myself, not because someone told me to."

We sat together in the kitchen, morning sunlight warm on our skin, while the rest of Liberty Beach read about the Morrison family drama over their own breakfast tables.

This wasn't a perfect ending. My parents still had doubts. Mother still disapproved. Father was allowing my choice more than embracing it.

But it was honest. It was real. And it was a start.

The phone rang. Father answered it—a campaign volunteer, probably, or another reporter wanting a quote.

While he talked, Mother squeezed my hand. "Bring Lucas to dinner Thursday night. I want to meet the boy who turned my daughter into a rebel."

"I didn't turn into a rebel," I corrected. "I just stopped pretending to be perfect."

"Same thing, from my perspective," Mother said. But she smiled slightly. "Seven o'clock. Tell him to bring his manners."

"He has manners," I assured her.

"We'll see." Mother stood, collecting dishes. "Now eat your eggs before they get cold. And then call Lucas and tell him what we've decided. I'm sure he's been worried all night."

She was right. I'd been so focused on my own conversation with my parents that I hadn't thought about Lucas, probably lying awake wondering if my father had forbidden me from seeing him, if last night's public kiss had cost me too much.

I ate quickly, then excused myself to call him.

His voice when he answered sounded rough, tired. "Hello?"

"It's me," I said.

"Kate." Relief flooded his voice. "Are you okay? Your father didn't—I mean, how bad was it?"

"It was hard," I admitted. "But Lucas—they're going to let us be together. With rules and conditions and probably a lot of supervision, but they're not forbidding it."

Silence on the other end. Then: "Really?"

"Really. My father apologized. Admitted he'd been treating me as a campaign asset. Said I have the right to make my own choices." I smiled. "Even if those choices give him gray hair."

Lucas laughed—surprised, delighted. "Kate Morrison, you actually did it. You changed your father's mind."

"We changed it," I corrected. "You helped me find the courage."

"When can I see you?" he asked.

"How about now? Meet me at the old pier in twenty minutes?"

"Your parents will let you go?"

"It's daylight, it's public space, and I told them where I'm going. That should satisfy the rules." I paused. "Plus, Lucas—my mom wants you to come to family dinner Thursday night."

Another silence. "Your mother wants me at family dinner?"

"She wants to meet the boy who turned her daughter into a rebel."

"I didn't—"

"I know. I told her the same thing. Seven o'clock Thursday. Bring your manners."

"Kate, I don't know if this is a good idea—"

"It's a great idea," I interrupted. "It means they're accepting this is real. Accepting you're part of my life now."

"Accepting or tolerating?" Lucas asked wryly.

"Tolerating with a side of accepting," I admitted. "But it's progress."

"Okay," he said. "Okay. I'll be there. Both at the pier in twenty minutes and at dinner Thursday."

"Good. I'll see you soon."

I hung up and found both my parents watching me from the kitchen doorway.

"Going to meet him?" Father asked.

"Yes. At the old pier. I'll be back in two hours."

Father nodded. "Be safe. And Kate—" He paused. "Thank you. For being honest last night. For forcing me to see what I'd become. I needed that wake-up call."

"You're welcome, Father."

I grabbed my cardigan and headed for the door.

"Kate?" Mother called.

I turned.

"I'm trying," she said simply. "To see you instead of my idea of you. I'm trying."

"That's all I ask," I said.

And I left to meet Lucas at the old pier, where I'd first discovered what it felt like to be real.

Where it had all begun.
