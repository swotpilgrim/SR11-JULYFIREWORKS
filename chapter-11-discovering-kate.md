# Chapter 11: Discovering Kate

"What's your favorite color?"

Lucas's question caught me off guard. We were sitting at the pier's end, afternoon sun warm on our shoulders, watching sailboats dot the horizon.

"Blue," I said automatically. Then stopped. "Wait. Is it?"

"You tell me."

I thought about it—really thought, not just reaching for the answer I'd been giving since childhood. The answer that matched my bedroom curtains and campaign color scheme and the dress Mother had chosen for my sixteenth birthday.

"I don't think I've ever chosen," I admitted. "Blue is appropriate. Safe. Goes with everything. But is it my favorite? I have no idea."

Lucas gestured to the water around us—shades of green and gray and deep blue, white-capped waves catching sunlight, the whole spectrum of ocean colors.

"So look. What calls to you?"

I studied the water, letting myself actually feel instead of perform. "That color," I said finally, pointing to where the water turned almost teal in the shallow areas. "That blue-green. It's alive. It changes. It's not trying to be proper."

"Then that's your color."

"Can I just choose that? Just decide?"

"Kate." Lucas looked at me with patient amusement. "It's a color. You're allowed to like what you like."

Such a simple statement. Such a revolutionary concept.

That's how it started—Lucas asking questions I'd never been allowed to answer honestly.

---

"Sweet or salty?"

We were sharing french fries from McCarthy's Diner, stolen in a to-go bag, eating them on the pier like teenage delinquents instead of proper young ladies.

"Sweet," I said. Then reconsidered. "Actually,  salty. Definitely salty."

"You sure?"

"I've been ordering vanilla milkshakes and strawberry pie for years because Mother says they're ladylike. But what I actually crave?" I grabbed another fry, savoring the salt. "This. Salty, greasy, completely inappropriate french fries."

Lucas grinned. "Rebel."

---

"Dogs or cats?"

"I've never had a pet. Father says animals are too much responsibility during campaign season."

"That wasn't the question."

I thought about it. "Dogs, I think. Something big and messy and enthusiastically happy. The opposite of careful and controlled."

"You want a dog?"

"I want a lot of things I'm not allowed to have."

Lucas didn't push, but I saw understanding in his eyes.

---

"Morning person or night person?"

"Morning. I have to be. Campaign breakfasts, volunteer meetings, proper young ladies rise early—" I stopped. "But honestly? I hate mornings. I'd stay up late if I could. Read until 2 a.m., sleep until noon, watch the sun set instead of rise."

"So you're a night person."

"Apparently I am."

Each answer felt like discovering a stranger living inside my skin. A Kate Morrison I'd never been allowed to meet.

---

"What makes you laugh? Really laugh, not polite chuckling."

I had to think about that one. When did I actually laugh?

"Absurdity," I said finally. "Things that don't make sense. Like America throwing up on Main Street. Or the fact that Mrs. Henderson thinks flag arrangement reflects moral character. Or when you said that thing about rebellious bunting undermining family values."

"So you like when things get ridiculous?"

"I like when someone points out how ridiculous they already are." I picked at a splinter on the pier. "Everything in my life is so serious—Father's campaign, my reputation, proper behavior. But it's all kind of absurd when you think about it. We're acting like bunting order will determine the election."

"It might."

"Which is absurd!"

Lucas laughed. "There she is."

"Who?"

"Real Kate. The one who thinks it's all a little ridiculous."

---

One afternoon, Lucas brought books from his small collection. "Pick one. Any one. Don't think about what you should read or what's appropriate. Just what calls to you."

I studied the worn paperbacks—philosophy, Beat poetry, science fiction, mystery novels. My hand hesitated over Simone de Beauvoir, then moved to a dog-eared copy of "The Martian Chronicles."

"Science fiction?" Lucas looked surprised. "Really?"

"Is that weird?"

"No. Just unexpected."

I opened the book, reading the first few lines. "I like the idea of Mars. A whole new world where nobody knows who you're supposed to be. Where you could be anyone."

"Escape fantasy."

"Maybe. Or maybe just the dream of a blank slate."

Lucas studied me. "What would you be if you got that blank slate? If you landed on Mars and nobody knew you were the mayor's daughter?"

The question hung between us like an invitation.

"I'd be curious," I said slowly, working it out as I spoke. "I'd ask questions nobody wants to answer. I'd read what I wanted and laugh when things are funny and cry when they're sad. I'd say 'I don't know' when I don't know instead of pretending certainty."

"That's not Mars. That's just being honest."

"On Mars I could be honest without consequences."

"Fair point."

I kept the book. Read it over the next week. Discovered I loved science fiction—the possibilities, the questions, the way it made the familiar strange and the strange familiar.

Another piece of Kate emerging from beneath the performance.

"Skip stones or swim?"

"I don't swim."

"Can't or don't?"

"Don't. Mother says swimming in the bay is unladylike. Public pools are full of germs. The ocean is dangerous."

"But can you swim?"

"I took lessons at the country club pool when I was nine. Before Mother decided it wasn't appropriate."

"So you can, but you don't."

"Correct."

Lucas looked at me thoughtfully. "Would you want to? If nobody was watching?"

I looked at the water lapping at the pilings below us. "Yes. I think I would."

"Then someday we'll swim. When it's late and dark and nobody's around to tell you it's unladylike."

The promise settled warm in my chest.

---

"What do you dream about? Not career or college. Actual dreams when you sleep."

Nobody had ever asked me that.

"Flying, mostly. I'm standing on a cliff or a rooftop, and I jump, and instead of falling I just... fly. No wings, no aircraft. Just me and the air and freedom." I felt embarrassed admitting it. "That's stupid, isn't it?"

"It's honest. What else?"

"Sometimes I dream I'm someone else. Different name, different face, different life. I wake up disappointed that I'm still me."

"You want to escape yourself."

"No." I thought about it more carefully. "I want to escape who I've been forced to be. I dream about being allowed to discover who I actually am."

Lucas nodded like that made perfect sense.

---

One afternoon, he taught me to skip stones properly—patient, encouraging, laughing when I got competitive about it.

"You're terrible at losing," he observed after I'd thrown six stones trying to beat his record.

"I'm not terrible at losing. I just don't like it."

"That's what terrible at losing means."

I splashed water at him. He splashed back. We ended up wet and laughing like children.

The mayor's daughter didn't splash people or get her dress soaked or laugh until her sides hurt.

But Kate did.

And I was starting to think I liked Kate better.

---

"What scares you?"

We were lying on our backs on the pier planks, watching clouds shift overhead. The question came quiet, serious.

"Disappearing," I said after a long moment. "Not dying. Disappearing. Becoming so thoroughly the person everyone wants me to be that the real me—whoever she is—just stops existing. Like I'll wake up one day and realize I'm nothing but performance all the way through."

"Is that happening?"

"It was. Before this." I gestured between us. "Before you asked what my favorite color was. Before you made me think about what I actually want instead of what I'm supposed to want."

"And now?"

"Now I'm discovering this whole person inside me I never knew existed. Who likes blue-green and french fries and science fiction and absurdity. Who wants to swim at midnight and laugh until it hurts and maybe own a big messy dog someday." I turned my head to look at him. "You're helping me find her."

"I'm just asking questions."

"You're the first person who cared about the answers."

Lucas rolled onto his side, propping his head on his hand, looking down at me. "I care about the answers because I care about you."

My breath caught. "Lucas—"

"Not the mayor's daughter. Not the perfect campaign prop. You. Kate. The real person underneath." His dark eyes were serious. "That's who I want to know."

"I'm still discovering who that is."

"Then let me discover her with you."

The moment stretched between us—charged, significant, teetering on the edge of something we couldn't take back.

I sat up, breaking the intensity. "We should get back. Mother will wonder where I am."

"Right. Yeah. Of course."

We walked back across the pier in silence, but it wasn't uncomfortable. It was full of things we hadn't quite said.

---

That night, lying in bed, I made a list in my head:

Kate Morrison likes blue-green and salty food and late nights and science fiction and absurdity and laughing until it hurts and the dream of flying.

Kate Morrison wants a big messy dog and midnight swims and the freedom to ask questions.

Kate Morrison is afraid of disappearing but brave enough to keep searching.

Kate Morrison is funny and competitive and curious and real.

Kate Morrison is someone I actually want to be.

And that terrified me. Because the more I discovered Kate, the harder it became to perform Katherine. The more I learned about who I could be, the less I could tolerate being who I was supposed to be.

Lucas was right—I was rebelling.

Not through defiance or scandal. Through discovery.

By finding out who I was when nobody was watching, I was becoming someone who couldn't hide anymore.

And I had no idea what happened when the real Kate and the performed Katherine finally couldn't coexist.

But for now, on that condemned pier with a boy who asked questions nobody else thought to ask, I was becoming someone I recognized.

Someone I might even like.

And that was worth whatever came next.
