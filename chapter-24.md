# Chapter 24: Breaking Point

"And I want to thank my daughter, Katherine," Father's voice rang out across Town Square, "who has organized this wonderful celebration and represents the very best of Liberty Beach's young people."

This was my cue. Step forward, wave, smile. The moment I'd rehearsed. The moment that would seal everything.

I stood frozen in the wings.

Through the gap in the curtain, I could see Father gesturing toward where I should appear. The crowd turning, expectant. Mr. Henderson beside me, whispering urgently, "Katherine, go! It's your cue!"

But I didn't move.

I watched Father's speech falter slightly as I failed to appear on cue. Watched him recover, continuing: "Katherine embodies the values we hold dear—dedication, responsibility, commitment to community."

Each word felt like a weight pressing down on my chest.

Mother appeared beside Mr. Henderson. "Kate, what are you doing? Get out there!"

I looked at her. Really looked at her. At the anxiety in her eyes, the desperate need for me to comply, to perform, to be the daughter she'd crafted so carefully.

"She's going to blow it," Mr. Henderson hissed. "Get her out there!"

Mother gripped my arm. "Katherine Morrison, you will walk out on that stage right now and support your father. Do you understand me?"

I understood perfectly. That was the problem.

I understood that for sixteen years, I'd been performing. Playing the role of perfect daughter, sublimating every genuine impulse, calculating every word and action for political advantage. I understood that my entire identity had been constructed around what other people needed me to be.

And I understood that if I walked out on that stage right now, I would be confirming that performance as permanent. Accepting that this was who I would be forever—Kate Morrison, Political Asset. Never just Kate.

Father was still speaking: "She is the future of our town, the embodiment of family values and traditional principles—"

The irony crashed over me. Family values. Traditional principles. As if those phrases meant anything when the actual person—the real Kate underneath all the polish—didn't matter at all.

I thought about Lucas at the old pier, seeing me. Not the performance, not the role, but the actual person I'd been before I'd learned to hide her so thoroughly.

I thought about three weeks of discovering preferences and opinions and a voice I'd never known I had. Three weeks of being real.

And I thought about spending the rest of my life wondering what might have happened if I'd been brave enough to choose authenticity over approval.

The weight of that future—safe, appropriate, hollow—became unbearable.

I looked at David in the front row, waiting to escort me after the speech. Pleasant, appropriate David who would give me a pleasant, appropriate life where I'd never feel anything strongly enough to risk comfort for it.

I looked at Mother beside me, desperate for me to comply, to perform, to sacrifice myself for Father's ambitions one more time.

I looked at Father onstage, in mid-speech, talking about me like I was a campaign symbol instead of a person with feelings and rights and my own dreams.

And I looked at Lucas at the crowd's edge. Lucas who'd released me because he thought I belonged in Father's world. Lucas who'd walked away to protect me, thinking he wasn't worth the cost.

Lucas who'd shown me what it felt like to be real.

Something inside me snapped. Not broke—snapped into place. Like a puzzle piece finding where it actually belonged after being jammed into the wrong spot for years.

"No," I said quietly.

Mother's grip tightened. "What?"

"No." Louder this time. "I'm not doing this."

Mr. Henderson looked panicked. "Katherine, your father is waiting—"

"I don't care." And I realized I meant it. I actually didn't care about Father's speech or Mr. Henderson's careful staging or Mother's anxiety about appearances.

For the first time in my life, I cared more about being myself than being appropriate.

"You're going to ruin everything," Mother said, voice shaking. "The campaign, the family, your future—"

"Maybe," I agreed. "Or maybe I'm finally going to have a future that's actually mine."

I stepped away from her, away from Mr. Henderson's urgent whispers, away from the wings where I was supposed to wait until called like an obedient pet.

But I didn't step onto the stage.

Instead, I stepped around the stage, into the crowd. People turned to stare—the mayor's daughter in her patriotic dress, walking away from her cue, away from her father's speech, away from her assigned role.

I heard Mr. Henderson's strangled gasp. Heard Mother's horrified "Katherine!"

Heard Father's speech stumble and halt as he realized I wasn't coming.

But I kept walking. Through the crowd, people parting in confusion, whispers spreading like wildfire. The mayor's daughter, walking away from the stage. Walking away from her father. What's she doing?

My heart hammered so hard I thought it might burst through my ribs. Every instinct screamed at me to turn back, to apologize, to climb on stage and perform my role like I'd been trained.

But I didn't turn back.

Because I'd spent sixteen years doing what everyone else needed. And I'd discovered, briefly, what it felt like to do what I needed.

And now I couldn't—wouldn't—go back to the cage, no matter how gilded it was.

Father had stopped speaking entirely now. The crowd buzzed with shocked murmurs. Campaign volunteers looked horrified. David stood frozen, bewildered.

And I kept walking.

Toward the edge of the crowd. Toward Lucas.

He saw me coming and his expression shifted from surprise to confusion to something that might have been hope.

I reached him, breathless, heart racing, terrified and exhilarated all at once.

"Kate?" he said uncertainly. "What are you—"

"I can't do it," I interrupted. "I can't go up there and pretend anymore. I can't be who they need me to be."

Lucas glanced past me at the chaos I'd left behind—Father standing speechless on stage, Mother pushing through the crowd toward us, campaign volunteers in a panic.

"Kate, this is—your father's speech—"

"I don't care about the speech," I said fiercely. "I don't care about the campaign or the perfect image or what everyone thinks I should be."

Behind me, I could hear Father's voice over the microphone, trying to recover: "It appears we're having some technical difficulties. If everyone could just—"

Technical difficulties. That's what I was. A malfunction in the political machine.

"You said I belonged in that world up on Beach Hill," I told Lucas. "You said we were from different worlds and they didn't line up."

"Kate—"

"But what if I don't want that world?" I grabbed his hand, not caring who saw, who would report it, who would be scandalized. "What if the only world I want to be in is the one where I'm real? Where I can be Kate instead of Katherine Morrison, Political Asset?"

Lucas looked at me—really looked at me. I saw the war on his face, between hope and caution, between wanting to believe and knowing the cost.

"Your father will destroy my family," he said quietly. "Building inspectors, the pier, his campaign speeches—"

"Then we'll fight it. Together." I squeezed his hand. "I'm not choosing you over my father, Lucas. I'm choosing myself. I'm choosing to be authentic instead of appropriate. To be real instead of perfect."

"Kate, everyone's watching—"

"Good. Let them watch." I was shaking but I'd never felt more certain of anything. "I'm done performing. Done pretending. Done being who everyone else needs me to be."

The crowd had gone almost silent, hundreds of people watching the mayor's daughter hold hands with Lucas Wade at the edge of the celebration she'd organized.

I could see Mother pushing closer, face red. Could see campaign volunteers conferring in panic. Could see David looking utterly lost.

Could see Father on the stage, speechless for perhaps the first time in his political career.

And I didn't care.

Because for the first time in sixteen years, I was doing exactly what I wanted instead of what was expected.

It was terrifying.

It was liberating.

It was real.

"Kate Morrison," Lucas said slowly, wonderingly. "You're actually doing this. You're choosing—"

"I'm choosing me," I said. "And I'm choosing you. If you'll have me. Even though it's complicated and messy and is going to make everyone angry."

A smile broke across Lucas's face—genuine, unguarded, full of hope and amazement. "You're crazy. You know that? This is going to be a disaster."

"Probably," I agreed. "But at least it'll be my disaster. My choice. My life."

And standing there at the edge of the crowd, holding Lucas's hand while Liberty Beach watched in shock, I finally felt like myself.

Real. Authentic. Free.

Whatever came next, I'd chosen it.

That made all the difference.
