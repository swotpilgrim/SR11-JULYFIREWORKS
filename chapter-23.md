# Chapter 23: Fourth of July Arrives

July Fourth, 1957, dawned bright and hot—the kind of perfect summer day that felt designed for celebration.

I woke at six, though the festivities wouldn't begin until ten. Sleep had been elusive anyway, my mind cycling through checklists and schedules and the weight of what today represented.

Today I would stand onstage with Father and prove to Liberty Beach that Katherine Morrison had returned to her proper place. Today the performance would reach its grand finale. Today I would confirm every choice I'd made—or had made for me—over the past two weeks.

Mother appeared in my doorway at seven. "Time to start getting ready, sweetheart. Today needs to be perfect."

Perfect. Always perfect.

She'd laid out my outfit with military precision. The white dress with its red belt and blue accents. The red headband. The white gloves. Patriotic to the point of caricature, but that was the idea. I was meant to look like the embodiment of American values—wholesome, traditional, appropriate.

The spirit of Liberty, Mother had said.

The irony was suffocating.

Mother helped me dress, her hands quick and efficient. She'd done this hundreds of times—prepared me for campaign events, photo opportunities, public appearances. I was her masterwork, the perfectly presented daughter.

She applied my makeup—natural looking but camera-ready. Fixed my hair in a style that looked effortless but had taken thirty minutes to achieve. Added the red headband like a crown.

"Beautiful," she declared, stepping back to admire her work. "Absolutely perfect. The newspapers will love you."

I looked in the mirror and saw a stranger. A pretty stranger in a patriotic costume, ready to perform her role in the political theater.

"It's almost time," Mother said. "Your father is already at Town Square overseeing final preparations. We'll meet him there at nine-thirty."

Nine-thirty. Thirty minutes before the official start. Time for last-minute checks, for positioning, for the calm before the performance.

I followed Mother downstairs and ate breakfast mechanically. Toast and fruit, enough to sustain me through the twelve-hour event but not enough to risk any wardrobe mishaps. Everything calculated, even my meals.

At nine-fifteen, we climbed into Father's campaign car—a Buick with small American flags attached to the hood. The driver, one of Father's volunteers, smiled at me in the rearview mirror.

"Big day, Miss Morrison. You must be excited."

"Very excited," I lied automatically.

The drive to Town Square took only five minutes, but crowds were already gathering. Families with children, elderly couples with folding chairs, teenagers in groups. All of Liberty Beach turning out for the celebration I'd organized.

My triumph. My cage.

Town Square looked magnificent. All my planning had paid off—the decorations were flawless, the stage imposing, the vendor booths perfectly positioned. Red, white, and blue everywhere, bunting and flags creating a picture-perfect scene of American celebration.

Campaign volunteers rushed over when they saw our car. "Katherine! Everything's ready. It's going to be spectacular!"

I stepped out of the car, and immediately the performance began. Smile in place, I greeted volunteers, checked last-minute details, projected calm confidence. The efficient organizer, the proud daughter, the perfect young woman.

Father found me near the stage. He wore his best suit despite the heat, American flag pin on his lapel, confidence radiating from every pore.

"Katie-bird," he said, using the childhood nickname I hadn't heard in years. "This is magnificent. You've outdone yourself."

The praise should have felt good. Instead, it felt heavy.

"Thank you, Father. I wanted it to be special for you."

"It is. It's perfect." He squeezed my shoulder. "And having you up there with me during the speech—that's going to mean everything. You know that, don't you? You standing beside me shows Liberty Beach what our family stands for."

What I'd surrendered for, he meant.

"I'm honored to stand with you," I said, because that was my line.

Mr. Henderson appeared with his clipboard and megaphone. "Ten minutes to opening ceremonies! Volunteers, to your positions!"

The celebration was beginning.

The morning passed in a blur of scheduled activities. The children's parade at ten—dozens of kids on decorated bicycles waving flags. The patriotic sing-along at ten-thirty. The pie-eating contest at eleven. Everything running exactly on time, exactly as planned.

I circulated through the crowd with Mother, greeting constituents, accepting compliments on the celebration, embodying the perfect political daughter. Everyone I met had the same message: So glad you've straightened out. That business with the Wade boy was concerning. You're much better with David Hartwell. Your father must be so proud.

Over and over, the same narrative. The wayward daughter who'd seen the error of her ways. The scandal contained. The happy ending achieved.

I smiled and agreed and thanked them for their support.

David found me around noon, looking fresh despite the heat in his seersucker suit. "Kate! This is incredible. You've thought of everything."

"Thank you. It's been a lot of work, but worth it."

He offered his arm. "Mind if I escort you? I think people expect to see us together."

Of course they did. That was the whole point.

We walked arm-in-arm through the celebration, the perfect young couple. More photographs, more approving nods, more confirmation that order had been restored.

Jen and Tommy joined us for lunch at one of the food vendors. We ate hot dogs and talked about the band that would play at two, about the games being set up for the afternoon, about how well everything was going.

Normal conversation. Normal friends doing normal things.

Except nothing about this felt normal to me. I felt like I was watching myself from a distance, observing the performance without truly participating.

The afternoon entertainment began—the band playing patriotic songs and popular hits, couples dancing in the designated area, children playing games. Town Square was packed now, hundreds of people enjoying the perfect celebration.

Father's speech was scheduled for five o'clock, positioned to be the climax of the day before the evening activities and fireworks finale. Everything was building toward that moment—the moment I'd stand beside him and prove my loyalty, my appropriateness, my return to the fold.

At four-thirty, Mr. Henderson found me. "Time to get ready, Katherine. Your father wants to do a final run-through backstage."

Backstage was a curtained area behind the wooden stage. Father was there with his speechwriter, reviewing note cards. He looked up when I entered.

"There's my girl. Ready for the big moment?"

"Ready," I confirmed.

We reviewed my positioning—where I'd stand during the speech, when I'd step forward after he mentioned me, where I'd be for the final photograph. I'd done this at rehearsal, but Mr. Henderson wanted it perfect.

Simple. Clean. Effective. Political theater.

At ten minutes to five, the band finished their set. Mr. Henderson took the stage to introduce Father. The crowd gathered close, hundreds of faces turned toward the stage with anticipation.

This was it. The moment everything had been building toward.

I stood backstage in my patriotic dress, white gloves on my hands, red headband in my hair. The embodiment of appropriate American girlhood. The mayor's perfect daughter, ready to play her role.

Father turned to me one last time. "Thank you, Katie. For all of this. For being who I needed you to be."

Who I needed you to be. Not who I was. Who he needed.

"You're welcome, Father."

Mr. Henderson finished the introduction. The crowd applauded. Father straightened his tie and walked onstage into the spotlight.

My cue would come in about ten minutes, during the personal portion of his speech. Until then, I waited in the wings, watching him perform his role as I prepared to perform mine.

Through a gap in the curtain, I could see the crowd. Hundreds of people. Campaign volunteers with Morrison buttons. Families on blankets. David standing prominently in the front, ready to be seen with me afterward.

And there, at the very edge of the crowd, half-hidden by a vendor booth—

Lucas.

He came. Despite everything, despite releasing me, despite knowing what this day represented, Lucas came.

Our eyes met across the distance. His expression was unreadable—not angry, not accusing, just watching.

Watching me prepare to make my final choice.

My heart hammered in my chest. Father's voice droned on—liberty, values, family, leadership. The words I'd heard at rehearsal, building toward the moment when he'd call me out and I'd step into the spotlight.

Proving to everyone—to the town, to the campaign, to Lucas—that I'd chosen appropriately.

That I'd chosen performance over authenticity. Safety over truth. My father's ambitions over my own identity.

Father's speech reached the section about traditional values. Getting closer now. Any minute, he'd gesture toward the wings and call my name.

Any minute, I'd have to step out there and confirm every compromise I'd made.

I looked at Lucas. He looked at me. The crowd between us might as well have been an ocean.

Father's voice grew more emphatic. "And I want to thank..."

This was it. My cue. Time to step into the spotlight and complete the performance.

Time to become who they'd always needed me to be.

Forever.
