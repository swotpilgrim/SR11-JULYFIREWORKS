# Chapter 12: Labels and Limits

The afternoon sun was brutal, turning the pier into a griddle. Lucas had shed his leather jacket—first time I'd seen him without it—revealing a plain white t-shirt and surprisingly strong arms.

"Aren't you hot in that dress?" he asked, watching me fan myself with my hand.

"Dying. But I have a committee meeting in an hour. Can't show up sweaty and disheveled."

"God forbid the mayor's daughter sweat."

I heard the edge in his voice. "What's wrong?"

Lucas was quiet for a long moment, staring out at the water. Then: "Do you know what happened yesterday?"

"No. What?"

"I was at Miller's General Store picking up motor oil. Mrs. Henderson came in with her daughter—Caroline, I think? They walked right past me like I wasn't there. Not rude, not cold. Just... invisible. Like I literally didn't exist in their world."

I wanted to defend Mrs. Henderson but couldn't. I'd seen her do the exact same thing.

"Then Mr. Thompson came in," Lucas continued. "Saw me, frowned, pulled Mrs. Miller aside and asked if she was comfortable having 'that Wade boy' unsupervised in her store. Like I was going to shoplift motor oil."

"Lucas—"

"Mrs. Miller defended me, told him I've been coming in since I was twelve and never caused problems. But that's not the point. The point is I'm labeled. Have been since eighth grade. And nothing I do changes it."

"What happened in eighth grade?"

Lucas picked up a stone, turned it over in his fingers. "Bobby Thompson—Mr. Thompson's son—was spreading rumors about my dad. Saying Wade's Garage cheated customers, overcharged for repairs, used cheap parts. It wasn't true, but Bobby kept saying it, and people started believing it.

"I confronted him after school. Asked him to stop. He laughed, said everyone knows mechanics are crooks, especially working-class ones who can't afford real education." Lucas's jaw tightened. "So I hit him."

"You got in a fight defending your father's reputation?"

"I broke his nose." He said it matter-of-factly. "Got suspended for two weeks. Bobby got nothing because I threw the first punch. And just like that, I was labeled. Troublemaker. Violent. Wasted potential. Every teacher looked at me differently after that. Every parent. Every kid."

"But you were defending your family."

"Doesn't matter. The label stuck." He threw the stone hard into the water. "I tried fighting it for a while. Did extra credit. Stayed out of trouble. Kept my head down. But people had decided who I was. So eventually I stopped trying."

"You gave up?"

"I stopped caring." Lucas looked at me. "It hurt less to be what they expected than to keep hoping they'd see something different."

I understood completely. We were mirror images—him trapped by low expectations, me trapped by impossible ones.

"I'm tired of it," Lucas said quietly. "Tired of being invisible or dangerous or wasted potential. Tired of having my whole life decided by one fight when I was fourteen. Tired of everyone assuming the worst."

"What do you want instead?"

"To be seen." Simple words, heavy with longing. "Really seen. As Lucas, not as 'that Wade boy.'"

"I see you," I said quietly.

"I know." He turned to look at me fully. "You're the only one who does. And you know what? It's the same for you. You think I don't notice how everyone treats you like a prop? How your own boyfriend doesn't actually know you? How your parents see a campaign asset instead of a daughter?"

"I'm not—"

"Kate, you're invisible too. Just in a different way. They see the performance and think that's all there is."

The words hit hard because they were true.

"I hate it," I whispered. "Hate being looked at without being seen. Hate having to perform every second. Hate that one mistake could ruin my father's campaign, so I can never just be human."

"The perfect daughter and the troublemaker."

"Two sides of the same cage."

We sat in heavy silence, both of us grappling with the weight of labels we hadn't chosen.

"Do you ever think about running away?" Lucas asked finally.

"All the time. Where would you go?"

"California maybe. Work as a mechanic in LA or San Francisco. Build custom bikes. Be anonymous in a big city where nobody knows my history."

"That sounds wonderful."

"What about you? Where would you run?"

I thought about it. "Somewhere nobody knows I'm the mayor's daughter. Where I could be Kate without any qualifications. Maybe college somewhere far away. Study what I want. Make my own choices. Be nobody's asset."

"We should go together." Lucas said it lightly, but something serious lurked beneath. "Both escape our cages simultaneously. Start over somewhere neither of us has to perform."

"Scandal of the century. The mayor's daughter running off with the town troublemaker."

"Your father would have a heart attack."

"Your father would probably understand."

Lucas laughed, but it sounded sad. "Yeah. He would. He knows what it's like to be labeled. 'Working-class mechanic.' Like that defines everything about him."

"Is it the same? His label and yours?"

"Close enough. People assume because he works with his hands, he's not smart. That because he didn't go to college, he has nothing valuable to offer. But he's brilliant with engines. Can diagnose problems just by listening. Taught himself everything because nobody else would teach him."

Pride filled Lucas's voice. Despite everything, he loved his father.

"Your dad sounds amazing."

"He is. He's just not what Liberty Beach values." Lucas kicked at a loose board. "Same as me. We're useful when they need their cars fixed. Otherwise we're invisible."

"I'm sorry."

"For what?"

"For being part of the system that treats you that way. For having privilege you don't. For my father using your family as campaign examples of what's wrong with Liberty Beach."

Lucas looked at me seriously. "You're not responsible for your father's choices."

"Aren't I? I benefit from them. I live in that Victorian house on Beach Hill because Father's policies favor families like mine. I go to country clubs while you work at your dad's garage. I'm planning Fourth of July celebrations while you're invisible at Miller's General Store."

"Kate—"

"I'm part of the problem, Lucas. And I don't know how to not be."

"You're here," he said simply. "On this pier. Talking to me like I matter. Seeing me as Lucas instead of as 'that Wade boy.' That's something."

"Is it enough?"

"I don't know."

The honest answer hung between us.

"What would it take?" I asked quietly. "To change your label? To make people see you differently?"

Lucas considered. "In Liberty Beach? Nothing. The label is permanent. People don't change their minds here. They decided who I am when I was fourteen, and I'll be that person until I leave."

"That's hopeless."

"That's reality."

"I refuse to accept that." Surprising myself with the vehemence. "You're not wasted potential. You're not a troublemaker. You're intelligent and creative and kind and you see people—really see them. That has to count for something."

"It counts for you."

"Then I'll make it count for others."

Lucas smiled sadly. "How? By telling everyone at your country club that the Wade boy is actually a good person? They'll think you're naive or rebellious. It won't change anything."

"Then what do I do? Just accept that we live in this divided world where you're invisible and I'm trapped and nothing changes?"

"What do you want to do?"

I looked at him—this boy who asked questions nobody else thought to ask. Who saw through my performance to something real. Who was labeled and dismissed by a town that never looked deeper.

"I want to walk down Main Street holding your hand," I said recklessly. "I want to introduce you to my friends as someone I care about. I want to tell my father you're brilliant and kind and more interesting than anyone at his campaign events."

"Kate—"

"I want to stop pretending we don't matter. I want to acknowledge that what we have—whatever this is—it's real. And it shouldn't have to hide."

Lucas looked at me with something like wonder and terror mixed.

"You know what would happen if you did that?" he asked quietly.

"Yes. My father's campaign would be damaged. Mother would be horrified. David would be hurt. Mrs. Henderson would have opinions. The whole town would talk."

"And you'd be labeled too. The rebel. The disappointment. The mayor's daughter who threw everything away for the wrong boy."

"I know."

"So you understand why we can't."

I did understand. But understanding didn't make it hurt less.

Lucas reached out slowly, giving me time to pull away. When I didn't, he took my hand.

The touch was electric. Simple hand-holding, chaste by any standard, but it felt revolutionary. His calloused palm against mine. His fingers threading through my fingers. Skin on skin, real and warm and present.

"This is all we get," Lucas said quietly, looking at our joined hands. "Moments on this pier where nobody's watching. Stolen conversations and hand-holding in secret. That's the limit."

"I know."

"Can you live with that?"

Could I? Could I keep meeting Lucas in secret while dating David in public? Keep lying to my parents? Keep performing perfect Kate while the real Kate developed feelings for someone she wasn't supposed to touch?

"For now," I said. "It has to be enough. Because losing this—losing you—would be worse."

Lucas's thumb traced circles on the back of my hand. "What if it's not enough forever?"

"Then we'll deal with forever when it comes."

"Kate, forever might come sooner than you think. Your father's election is in six weeks. After that, after the campaign is over, what happens to us?"

I hadn't let myself think that far ahead. Hadn't wanted to face the inevitable choice—continue hiding indefinitely, or risk everything by being honest.

"I don't know," I admitted.

"We should figure it out."

"Not today." I gripped his hand tighter. "Today, can we just have this? No planning, no worrying about the future. Just us, here, being real."

Lucas studied my face. Then nodded. "Okay. For today."

We sat together as the sun moved lower, hands linked, watching the water shift colors. Not talking about labels or limits or impossible futures.

Just being Kate and Lucas. Real and present and honest.

For today, in this moment, on this pier, we had each other.

And despite all the labels and limits and impossible circumstances, that felt like everything.

Even if I knew it couldn't last.

Even if I was terrified of what came next.

Even if the whole thing was hopeless from the start.

His hand in mine felt like possibility.

And I wasn't ready to let go.
