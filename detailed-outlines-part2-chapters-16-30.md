**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words  
**POV:** Kate Morrison, first person  
**Setting:** Morrison House living room  
**Time:** Evening, July 9th

**Purpose:** Father's ultimatum forces Kate to choose between authentic self and family loyalty, marking story's midpoint crisis.

**Beats:**
- That evening, father sits Kate down alone. His anger has cooled to weary frustration. He explains he's worked eight years building this town—new schools, infrastructure, business development. He's proud of accomplishments and believes he's best person to continue the work.
- Father asks Kate directly: is Lucas Wade worth destroying everything they've built? Kate wants to say yes but words stick. Father continues—she's sixteen; whatever she feels will pass. But damage to his career, their reputation could be permanent.
- Father clarifies he's not asking her to stop caring about Lucas; he's asking her to think about consequences beyond herself. This is the midpoint: Kate must choose between growing authentic self and family role.
- Father gives ultimatum: end relationship publicly, or he'll take measures hurting Lucas's family—mentioning Wade's Garage in speeches about business regulations, having building inspector examine old pier. He's threatening Lucas to control Kate. Kate is horrified but trapped.

**Dialogue Topics:** Father's explanation of his eight years of work, his question about whether Lucas is worth the destruction, father's assurance Kate's feelings will pass, ultimatum presented calmly but firmly, specific threats against Wade's Garage and old pier, Kate's horrified silence.

- Eleanor has coordinated with David's mother. Kate will smile, be charming, demonstrate appropriate behavior. The message: Kate Morrison dates right sort of boy; previous rumors were exaggerated gossip.
- Kate mechanically selects perfect dress for performing perfect daughter again. She feels suffocated by return to performance. Jen visits trying to be supportive, suggesting maybe this is for best—Lucas is exciting but David is safe, predictable, appropriate. Jen doesn't understand Kate's despair.
- Dance is in two days. Kate hasn't seen Lucas since ultimatum; she's been kept busy with campaign events. She knows she needs to talk to Lucas, to explain, but doesn't know what to say. How do you tell someone they're not worth the cost?

- Late nights, Kate lies awake thinking about Lucas alone at pier, thinking she abandoned him. She thinks about father's disappointment, mother's anxiety. She thinks about David's emptiness, future being planned for her. Kate doesn't know who she is anymore—perfect daughter or authentic self.

- Lucas is hurt but not surprised—this is what powerful people do. Tom rants about political corruption, not knowing his son is real target. Lucas decides he won't let Kate's family destroy father's business because of him. Decent thing is letting Kate go. He's been selfish thinking someone like her could be with someone like him.

- Lucas tells Kate she should do what father asks—attend dance with David, play perfect daughter, protect her family. Kate protests but Lucas is firm. He was stupid thinking this could work. They're from different worlds; he knew that from beginning. Their summer friendship was nice but time to face reality.
- Kate, stung by dismissal, argues she cares about him, doesn't want to return to performing. Lucas says caring isn't enough against town's pressure. He releases her from any obligation.

- Kate stands alone at docks feeling like she's lost something essential. That evening, she puts on perfect dress, goes to dance with David. Newspaper photographs them together.
