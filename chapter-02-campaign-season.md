# Chapter 2: Campaign Season

The Liberty Beach Country Club smelled of fresh flowers, expensive perfume, and carefully maintained privilege.

White-clothed tables filled the main dining room beneath crystal chandeliers that caught the morning light. Men in summer suits discussed business and politics over coffee and toast points. Women in tailored dresses and wide-brimmed hats compared notes on garden parties and charity drives. Liberty Beach's elite—the donors and influencers who kept my father in office and decided which families mattered.

Every single one of them looked up when we entered. The Morrison family. Always watched. Always on display.

"Richard!" Mr. Peterson approached immediately. "Eleanor. And young Katherine—don't you look lovely."

I offered my practiced smile. "How nice to see you, Mr. Peterson."

"Growing up so fast. Must be seventeen now?"

"Sixteen," Mother corrected. "A senior this fall."

"Time flies." He turned to Father. "Now, Richard, about those zoning changes..."

They moved away, conversation excluding me as naturally as breathing. Presented like a china doll, admired, then set aside.

"Katie!"

I turned to find David Hartwell approaching, looking exactly as I'd expected. Pressed khaki slacks, white shirt, blue blazer with gold buttons. His sandy hair was combed neatly, his smile pleasant and utterly predictable. He looked like he'd stepped out of a college recruitment poster.

"Hi, David."

"You look swell." He offered his arm like a gentleman in a magazine advertisement. "Our parents saved us seats at their table."

I took his arm because that's what was expected. We walked through the dining room together, and I felt eyes following our progress. Whispers behind gloved hands. Approving nods from the older women. Liberty Beach's golden couple—the mayor's daughter and the councilman's son. We looked perfect together. Everyone said so.

I felt absolutely nothing.

"I heard you're heading up the Fourth of July planning," David said. "That's a big responsibility."

"My father asked me to chair it."

David pulled out my chair. "I'd be happy to help if you need anything."

"That's very nice of you."

We sat with our parents and the Hendersons—major donors. Mrs. Henderson wore an elaborate hat, Mr. Henderson expensive cufflinks.

"Katherine, dear!" Mrs. Henderson leaned forward. "Your father tells us you're organizing the Fourth of July celebration?"

"I'm chairing the planning committee. We have wonderful volunteers—"

"So modest. Just like your mother." She patted my hand. "Now, tell me about your college plans. State College?"

"Yes, ma'am. English or education."

"How wonderful! Teaching is such an appropriate profession. So much better than these modern girls who want to be lawyers or doctors."

I smiled, stomach twisting.

The breakfast proceeded exactly as always. Father worked the room, shaking hands. Mother stayed at the table, gracious and supportive. I sat next to David and smiled at the right moments, laughed politely, agreed with opinions I didn't share.

"You're awfully quiet," David said. "Everything okay?"

"Just tired. Finals week."

"Summer's here now though. There's a sock hop next Saturday at the community center. Want to go?"

Every eye at the table turned toward us.

"That sounds nice," I heard myself say.

"Swell. I'll pick you up at seven."

Mother looked pleased. Mrs. Henderson delighted. Father nodded approval.

Another performance scheduled.

After the breakfast, Father pulled me aside near the entrance.

"Walk with me, Katie-girl."

We stepped onto the veranda overlooking the bay. Sailboats dotted the blue water. Perfect. Like a postcard.

"You did well in there," Father said. "The Hendersons are impressed. That matters."

"I'm glad."

"I meant what I said about the Fourth of July celebration. It's important, Kate. For the town and the campaign. Robert Caldwell is gaining ground with the working-class vote. He's painting me as out of touch."

"Are you?" The question slipped out.

Father looked at me sharply. "What?"

"Nothing. Sorry."

He studied me. "I serve all of Liberty Beach. But perception matters in politics. The Fourth of July celebration shows we're united. When they see the mayor's daughter working alongside regular volunteers, it sends a message."

"That you're one of them."

"That we're all in this together." His expression softened. "I'm not asking you to do anything dishonest. Just help organize a celebration our town deserves. Can you do that?"

"Of course, Father."

He kissed my forehead. "That's my girl."

Harper's Drugstore sat on Main Street's prime corner, red-and-white striped awning bright in the afternoon sun. I'd escaped there after Mother finished her shopping at Miller's, claiming I needed to pick up planning committee supplies. Really, I just needed to breathe air that wasn't heavy with expectations.

The soda fountain stretched along one side of the store—all chrome and red vinyl and gleaming surfaces that caught the afternoon light. A jukebox in the corner played Patti Page crooning "Old Cape Cod." The air smelled sweet, like cherry syrup and vanilla ice cream. Three other girls sat at the counter, Liberty Beach High classmates enjoying summer freedom.

"Kate!"

Jennifer Parker waved from a corner booth, her bright smile infectious as always. Jen had been my best friend since third grade, when she'd shared her lunch with me after I'd forgotten mine. Pink sundress with white polka dots, blonde ponytail bouncing as she gestured me over.

I slid into the booth across from her, grateful for genuine warmth after the morning's calculated politeness.

"How was the campaign breakfast?" Jen asked.

"Exactly what you'd expect."

"That bad? Let me guess—you sat with David, made small talk, and heard how lovely you look together."

"Four times, actually."

Jen laughed. "At least David's nice. Half the girls at school would kill to have him interested."

I traced a pattern on the tabletop. "I know."

"But?" Jen leaned forward.

"But nothing. He's nice. Appropriate. Our parents approve."

"Wow. Don't overwhelm me with enthusiasm."

Sally the waitress took our orders—two cherry Cokes, french fries to share—then left.

"I'm being unfair," I said. "David is nice. There's nothing wrong with him."

"Except you're not interested."

"I didn't say that."

"You didn't have to. I've known you forever. I can tell the difference between you being polite and actually caring. With David, you're polite."

Sally returned with frosted glasses, cherries bobbing. I took a sip, buying time.

"It doesn't matter what I'm interested in," I said finally. "My father's running for re-election. Everything I do reflects on his campaign. Dating David makes sense—our families align politically, we look good together, it sends the right message to voters."

"But what do you want?"

The question hung between us, simple and impossible.

"I want..." I stopped, realizing I didn't know how to finish that sentence. "I want my father to win his election. I want to do well on the Fourth of July planning. I want to not disappoint everyone."

"That's not what I asked." Jen's voice was gentle but firm.

Jen dated Tommy Wilson, planning to marry right after graduation. She genuinely seemed happy with her conventional path. I envied that certainty.

"I don't know what I want," I admitted. "Is that terrible?"

"It's honest." Jen sipped her Coke. "Tommy said you always look like you're somewhere else. Like you're performing being Kate Morrison instead of actually being her."

"Tommy said that?"

"But he's not wrong, is he?"

I didn't answer.

"I just worry about you," Jen said gently. "You're always taking care of everyone else—your father's campaign, your mother's expectations, David. When do you get to just be Kate?"

"I am Kate."

"Are you? When's the last time you did something just because you wanted to? Not because it was expected—just because it made you happy?"

I couldn't think of a single example.

The jukebox switched to The Everly Brothers. Through the window, Main Street carried on with Saturday afternoon business. Young couple walking toward the beach.

Everything looked so normal.

Why did I feel like I was drowning?

"David asked me to the sock hop next Saturday. Are you and Tommy going?"

Jen let me pivot. "Wouldn't miss it. Tommy's been practicing his dance moves—stepping on his mother's feet. Adorable and tragic."

I laughed, and it felt real.

"See? That's the Kate I miss. The one who laughs at silly things."

"I'm right here."

"Are you? Sometimes I think the real Kate is buried so deep under 'the mayor's daughter' that even you don't know where to find her."

I wanted to argue. But I couldn't make myself lie.

"I don't know how to be anyone else," I whispered.

Jen reached across and took my hands. "Then maybe it's time to figure it out."

The words settled into my chest.

Maybe she was right. Maybe I'd been performing so long I'd forgotten there was someone real underneath. Maybe the exhaustion wasn't normal—it was the weight of constantly pretending.

Maybe I was tired of being perfect.

"Come on," Jen said, pulling me up. "Let's walk to the beach. You need air that isn't full of campaign promises."

I followed her toward the door, leaving coins for our Cokes.

As we stepped outside, I caught my reflection in Harper's window. The girl with the perfect hair, perfect dress, perfect smile.

The perfect stranger.

I turned away and followed Jen toward the beach, where the salt air might help me remember how to breathe.
