# Chapter 9: Honest Connection

The old pier became our refuge.

Over the next week, I found excuses to slip away. Library research. Supply pickups. Vendor meetings. Mother accepted my explanations because Fourth of July planning was my responsibility, and I'd always been dutiful.

I'd never been a liar before. Now I lied almost daily.

Each time I walked to the docks, my heart hammered with fear and anticipation. Fear of being caught. Anticipation of seeing Lucas, of those hours when I could stop performing.

Tuesday afternoon, I found Lucas at the pier's end, sketchbook open on his lap. I'd seen the motorcycle designs in his journal before, but these were different—more detailed, more refined.

"Are those new?" I asked, settling beside him.

"Working on a custom design." He showed me. "This intake manifold improves airflow. This exhaust system—completely custom. Nobody's building bikes like this."

"It's beautiful. You're really talented."

He looked uncomfortable. "It's just sketches."

"These are dreams on paper. Have you thought about actually building this?"

"Every day. But custom fabrication requires tools I don't have, materials I can't afford, time I don't get." He closed the sketchbook. "Nice fantasy though."

"People like me don't get to chase dreams. We get to be practical. Dreams are for people like you."

"I don't have dreams," I said quietly. "I have expectations."

"Fair point." He looked out at the water. "So if you could dream, what would you want?"

The question caught me off guard. When had anyone asked what I wanted?

"I don't know," I admitted. "Isn't that terrible? I'm sixteen years old, and I have no idea what I actually want. College was chosen for me. My major was chosen for me. My boyfriend was basically chosen for me. Even my summer is planned around my father's campaign."

"You didn't choose David?"

"Our fathers arranged it. They didn't say 'you must date him,' but they made it clear he was appropriate. So I agreed to the movies. Then the sock hop. Suddenly we're dating."

"Do you even like him?"

"He's perfectly nice. Pleasant. Safe." I picked at a splinter. "But I don't feel anything. No spark. No connection."

"That sounds lonely."

"It is. I'm surrounded by people—family, friends, boyfriend, volunteers. And I'm completely alone because none of them see me. They see the mayor's daughter. The perfect prop."

Lucas was quiet. Then: "I see you."

My breath caught. "I know."

"That's why you keep coming back. You come back because here you can be real."

"Yes."

"Kate." Lucas turned to face me fully. "What do you want? Right now, in this moment, if nothing else mattered—what do you actually want?"

I looked at him—really looked. At his dark eyes that saw through every performance. At the scar through his eyebrow. At his intelligent face that everyone dismissed as trouble. At the boy who read philosophy and designed motorcycles and offered me the only honesty I'd found in years.

"This," I said. "I want this. Being honest, feeling real. I want to be seen as Kate instead of as a political asset."

"You have that here."

"I want more than stolen hours. I want to not lie about where I'm going. I want to talk to you in public without my parents dismissing you. I want to live in a world where it doesn't matter that you're a mechanic's son and I'm the mayor's daughter."

"But we don't."

"I know." Frustration sharpened my voice. "I know it's impossible. I know this can't exist outside this pier. But I still want it."

"What is this? Between us?"

My heart hammered. "I don't know. Friendship?"

"Is it?"

"I don't know. All I know is that talking to you feels more real than anything in my life. That I count hours until I can come here."

"I do the same thing. Count hours until you might show up."

Something warm bloomed in my chest.

"I've never told anyone the things I tell you," I said. "About feeling trapped. About not knowing who I am. About being exhausted from constant performance. I can't tell Jen because she wouldn't understand. I can't tell my parents because they're the ones creating the expectations. I can't tell David because he likes the performed version of me."

"You can tell me."

"Why do you care about the mayor's daughter's problems?"

"Because I know what it feels like to be trapped in a role you didn't choose. To be lonely because nobody sees past the label."

"The troublemaker and the perfect daughter."

"Two sides of the same cage. Maybe that's why I see you. I know what it's like to be invisible behind a performance."

"You're not invisible to me."

"I know. That's why I keep hoping you'll show up."

The air felt charged. Afternoon sun painted everything gold.

"If things were different—if I wasn't the mayor's daughter—would you want to be seen with me?"

"Kate, I'd be proud to be seen with you. The question isn't whether I'd want to. It's whether you'd risk being seen with me."

"I'm here, aren't I?"

"On a condemned pier where nobody comes." No accusation, just truth. "Secret meetings where you can be real before going back to your performed life."

The words stung because they were accurate.

"I'm sorry. I know it's not fair. I know I'm asking you to be my escape while offering nothing in return—"

"Kate." Lucas touched my hand, stopping me. "I didn't say I wanted you to stop. This pier is our place. What happens here is real, even if it can't exist anywhere else. That's enough."

"Really?"

"For now. I'd rather have honest conversations here than performed politeness anywhere else."

I looked down at our hands—his calloused from working on engines, mine soft from a life of privilege. They shouldn't fit together. Everything about us was wrong according to Liberty Beach's social order.

But sitting here, it felt more right than anything else in my life.

"Tell me something true," Lucas said. "Something you've never told anyone else."

I thought for a moment. Then: "I'm terrified that there's nothing real inside me. That I've performed perfect Kate for so long that the real Kate—whoever she was—is gone. That if I stripped away all the expectations and training and political smiling, there'd be nothing left. Just an empty shell that learned to be what everyone needed."

Lucas was quiet, absorbing this. Then: "You want to know what I think?"

"Always."

"I think the real Kate is the one sitting here right now. The one who admits she doesn't have all the answers. Who laughs at America throwing up on Main Street. Who understands Camus and questions her father's values and counts hours until she can be honest. That's real. That's you."

"How do you know?"

"Because performances are easy. They're smooth and practiced and never crack. But you? You crack all the time when you're here. You get frustrated and confused and honest and vulnerable. That's not performance. That's human."

Tears pricked my eyes. "I don't cry," I said automatically.

"Why not?"

"Because perfect daughters don't fall apart. We maintain composure. We handle stress gracefully. We—"

"Kate." Lucas squeezed my hand. "You're allowed to cry. You're allowed to fall apart. You're allowed to be human instead of perfect."

And suddenly I was crying—real tears, not delicate dabbing but actual messy crying. All the frustration and loneliness and confusion I'd been holding in for months, maybe years, came pouring out.

Lucas didn't tell me to stop. Didn't look uncomfortable. Just sat there holding my hand while I fell apart on a condemned pier.

When the tears finally slowed, I wiped my face with my sleeve—another thing perfect Kate would never do.

"Sorry," I said. "That was—"

"Real," Lucas finished. "That was real, Kate. And I'm honored you trusted me enough to let it happen."

I looked at him through blurry eyes. "You're the only person who sees me cry and thinks it's a good thing."

"Because it means you're being honest. Even with yourself." He pulled a relatively clean handkerchief from his pocket. "Here. Your mascara's running."

I laughed wetly, taking the handkerchief. "The mayor's daughter can't go home with raccoon eyes. The scandal."

"The horror."

We sat in companionable silence while I cleaned my face and pulled myself together. The sun had shifted lower, painting the water in shades of gold and pink.

"I need to get back," I said reluctantly. "Mother thinks I'm inspecting the Town Square stage setup."

"Right. Can't have her wondering where you actually are."

I stood, then hesitated. "Lucas? Thank you. For listening. For seeing me. For letting me fall apart."

"Anytime." He stood too. "That's what friends do, right?"

"Right. Friends."

The word felt inadequate for what we were becoming, but I didn't have another one that fit.

He walked me back across the pier, guiding me around the weak spots, his hand steadying me when I needed it. At the dock's edge, we stopped.

"Same time Thursday?" Lucas asked.

"If I can get away. Maybe Friday if not."

"I'll be here. Either day." He smiled. "I've got nowhere else to be."

I walked back toward Town Square, Lucas's handkerchief tucked in my pocket, my eyes still red from crying, my heart feeling simultaneously heavier and lighter than before.

I'd cried in front of someone. Admitted my deepest fear. Been completely, messily honest.

And Lucas had called it real.

Maybe he was right. Maybe the scared, confused girl who cried on piers was more Kate than the perfect daughter who never cracked.

Maybe being real meant being imperfect.

It was a dangerous thought.

But I couldn't let it go.
