# Chapter 8: The Hidden Place

I went back.

Not the next day—that would have been too obvious, too risky. But three days later, on a sweltering afternoon when Mother thought I was at the library researching historical Fourth of July celebrations for the program notes.

I'd actually gone to the library first. Checked out two books about Independence Day history. Solid alibi, just in case.

Then I walked to the docks.

Lucas was sitting in the same spot, reading the same worn copy of "On the Road." He looked up when my shadow fell across his book, and something in his expression shifted—surprise giving way to something that might have been pleasure.

"You came back," he said.

"I came back." I stood there awkwardly, suddenly uncertain. "Is that okay?"

"Yeah." He closed his book, marking his place with a finger. "More than okay. I just wasn't sure you would."

"Honestly? I wasn't sure either." I glanced around the docks—fishing boats, cannery workers, a few men loading supplies. "Is it safe to talk here? I mean, people can see us."

Lucas considered. "Want to see something?"

"See what?"

"A place nobody goes. Where we could actually talk without worrying about who's watching." He stood, tucking his book into his jacket. "That is, if you trust me enough to follow."

The old Kate—the perfect daughter Kate—would have said no. Would have made excuses about needing to get back, about propriety, about what people might think.

But I was tired of being that Kate.

"Show me," I said.

Lucas's smile was worth every risk.

He led me along the waterfront, past the fishing boats and the cannery, past Wade's Garage where I could see his father bent over an engine. We walked to where the working docks ended and the old structures began—weathered buildings that hadn't been used in years, piers that had seen better days.

"It's condemned," Lucas said, gesturing toward a pier that extended into the bay. "Been closed for five years. Structural damage, unsafe planking, liability issues. The town keeps saying they'll tear it down, but they never get around to it."

The pier looked like something from a ghost story—weathered gray wood, missing railings, planks that had rotted through in places. A faded sign warned: DANGER - NO TRESPASSING.

"You want me to go out there?" I asked.

"I go out there all the time. You just have to know which boards are safe." Lucas stepped onto the pier, testing each plank before putting his weight on it. "Come on. I'll show you which ones to avoid."

This was insane. Mother would have a heart attack. Father would ground me until I was thirty. If the pier collapsed and I drowned, it would be terrible for the campaign.

I stepped onto the first plank.

Lucas guided me carefully, pointing out weak spots, directing me around holes, offering his hand when I needed to jump over a particularly bad section. His palm was warm and calloused when I took it.

"Why do you come here?" I asked as we made our way toward the pier's end.

"Because it's the only place in Liberty Beach where nobody expects anything from me." Lucas navigated around a rotted section. "Out here, I'm not the troublemaker or the wasted potential or Tom Wade's problem son. I'm just... me."

I understood completely.

The pier stretched about fifty yards into the bay. At the end, most of the railing had fallen away, leaving an open platform with nothing but water below. The view was spectacular—Liberty Beach spread out behind us, the bay stretching endlessly ahead, seagulls wheeling overhead.

"Oh," I breathed. "Lucas, this is beautiful."

"Right?" He sat down on the edge, legs dangling over the water. After a moment's hesitation, I sat beside him. "This is my spot. Where I come to think, or read, or just exist without performing."

The afternoon sun glinted off the water. A warm breeze carried the smell of salt and seaweed. Below us, waves lapped against the pilings with a gentle, rhythmic sound.

"I've lived in Liberty Beach my whole life," I said quietly. "And I never knew this was here."

"Most people don't come to the working waterfront. Too industrial. Not picturesque enough for the tourists." Lucas pulled out his book. "Which is why it's perfect."

We sat in comfortable silence for a moment, listening to the water and the gulls.

"What do you think about when you come here?" I asked.

"Escaping, mostly." He said it matter-of-factly. "Building motorcycles somewhere far away. Going to places where nobody knows my father or my reputation. Just being Lucas Wade, whoever that is, without all the labels."

"Do you really want to leave Liberty Beach?"

"Sometimes. Other times I think I'd miss it—the ocean, the smell of engine oil from my dad's garage, even the judgmental looks from country club ladies." He smiled wryly. "It's complicated."

"Everything's complicated."

"Yeah." Lucas looked at me. "What about you? What do you think about? Besides Fourth of July planning and campaign strategies?"

The question caught me off guard. When had anyone asked what I actually thought about?

"Honestly? I think about disappearing," I admitted. "Not permanently. Just... stepping out of my life for a while. Being someone else. Someone who doesn't have to smile perfectly or say the right things or worry about every action reflecting on her father's political career."

"Someone who could just be Kate."

"Someone who knows who Kate even is."

Lucas was quiet for a moment. Then: "Want to know what I see when I look at you?"

My heart hammered. "What?"

"Someone smarter than she pretends to be. Funnier than she's allowed to show. Stronger than everyone gives her credit for." He turned to face me fully. "Someone who's been performing so long she's forgotten the performance isn't real."

The words hit somewhere deep in my chest.

"I don't know how to stop performing," I whispered.

"Start here." Lucas gestured to the pier, the water, the open sky. "This is neutral ground. Out here, you don't have to be the mayor's daughter. You can just be Kate. Say what you think. Laugh when something's funny. Be honest without calculating the political consequences."

"What if I don't remember how?"

"Then we'll figure it out together."

The word 'we' wrapped around me like warmth.

"Lucas," I said carefully. "Why are you being so nice to me? I'm the girl who stood silent while my father insulted you. I'm part of the system that labels you and dismisses you and—"

"You're also the girl who read Camus twice to understand it better," he interrupted. "Who laughs when America throws up on Main Street. Who came to the docks to apologize even though it was risky. Who's sitting on a condemned pier right now because she's desperate enough for honesty to break rules she's never broken before."

"How do you see all that?"

"Because I'm looking." His dark eyes held mine. "Really looking. Not at the performance, but at you."

Something shifted in the space between us. The air felt different—charged, significant.

"I like this place," I said, needing to break the intensity before I did something reckless. "This pier."

Lucas's mouth quirked. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. It's like you said—neutral ground. Outside both our worlds." I looked out at the water. "Can I come back? Not just today, but other times?"

"This can be our place," Lucas said. "When you need to escape the perfect daughter act, you know where to find me."

"Our place," I repeated, testing the words. They felt dangerous and wonderful.

We sat together as the afternoon wore on, talking about everything and nothing. Lucas told me about learning mechanics from his father, about building his motorcycle piece by piece. I told him about Fourth of July planning disasters, about Mrs. Henderson's obsession with proper flag display.

And slowly, without quite meaning to, we told each other true things.

About feeling trapped in lives that didn't fit. About wanting more but not knowing what more looked like. About the exhaustion of constant performance and the dangerous lure of authenticity.

About being seen.

The sun shifted lower, painting the water gold and pink.

"I need to get back," I said reluctantly. "Mother thinks I'm at the library."

"Right. Can't have the mayor's daughter missing." There was no bitterness in Lucas's voice, just understanding.

He guided me back across the pier, showing me again which planks to avoid. His hand steadied me over the bad sections. At the dock's end, we stopped.

"Thank you," I said. "For showing me this place. For letting me be honest."

"Thank you for coming back." Lucas hesitated, then added, "Kate? This thing we're doing—meeting here, talking—it's probably a bad idea. For both of us."

My stomach dropped. "You want to stop?"

"No. I'm just saying I know it's risky. For you especially. If someone finds out—"

"I know the risks." I met his eyes. "And I'm choosing to come back anyway."

Something in his expression turned softer. "Okay then."

"Okay."

I walked back toward town with library books tucked under my arm, my mind full of condemned piers and honest conversations and the feeling of being seen instead of just looked at.

Mother was waiting when I got home. She asked about my research. I showed her the books. She nodded approval.

I'd lied to her. Broken rules. Spent the afternoon on a condemned pier with exactly the boy I wasn't supposed to associate with.

And I felt more real than I had in years.

That night, lying in bed, I thought about neutral ground and honest conversations. About a place where I could be Kate instead of Katherine Morrison, campaign asset.

About Lucas saying "our place" like it was a promise.

It was reckless and dangerous and everything I'd been taught to avoid.

And I couldn't wait to go back.
