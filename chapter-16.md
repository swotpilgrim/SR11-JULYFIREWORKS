# Chapter 16: The Ultimatum

That evening, I sat in our living room while the grandfather clock ticked away the seconds. My father sat across from me in his favorite leather armchair, looking older than I'd ever seen him—not angry anymore, just tired. The campaign pamphlets on the side table mocked us both with their bright patriotic colors.

"Kate," he said finally, voice weary. "We need to talk. Really talk."

I folded my hands in my lap, the same way Mother had taught me for photographs. "Yes, sir."

He smiled slightly. "You don't have to call me 'sir' in our own living room. I'm your father, not the mayor. Not right now."

But we both knew that wasn't entirely true. He was always the mayor. I was always the mayor's daughter.

"I've been thinking all day," he continued. "About what happened. About Lucas Wade." He said the name carefully, trying it out without contempt. He didn't quite manage it.

Outside, cicadas sang their summer song. Somewhere down the street, children played kick-the-can.

"I've worked eight years building this town," Father said. "When I took office, Main Street was dying. The schools needed everything. Tourism was down." He leaned forward. "I got us federal funding for the new pier. I brought in the businesses that turned Main Street around. I fought for improvements at the school."

He wasn't wrong. Liberty Beach was better than eight years ago. I couldn't deny that.

"I've worked sixteen-hour days," Father said. "Missed dinners, missed—" He paused. "Missed a lot of things. But I believed I was doing good. Real good."

"I know," I said quietly. Whatever else my father was, he genuinely believed his work mattered.

"Robert Caldwell would undo half of what I've built," Father continued. "I need to win this election, Kate. Not for me—for Liberty Beach."

He believed that. And maybe it was even true.

"So I need to ask you something." Father looked at me directly, and his eyes were the same clear blue I'd inherited. "Is Lucas Wade worth destroying everything we've built? Everything I've worked for? Everything this family stands for?"

The question hung in the air. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. How did you weigh one person against eight years of work?

But that wasn't really the question. The real question was: was I worth it? Was being myself worth the cost?

I didn't know.

Father took my silence as uncertainty and pressed on, gentler now. "Kate, sweetheart, you're sixteen years old. Whatever you're feeling right now—and I'm not saying it isn't real to you—but these things pass. You'll go to college, meet other boys, have other experiences. This feeling you have for Lucas Wade, it won't last forever."

"You don't know that," I said.

"I do, actually." He smiled sadly. "I was sixteen once too. Thought I was in love with Mary Catherine O'Brien. Haven't thought about her in twenty years."

"This isn't the same," I protested weakly.

"Maybe it's not," Father conceded. "Maybe Lucas Wade is the great love of your life. But Kate, even if that's true—and I don't believe it is—the damage you'll cause could be permanent."

The clock ticked.

"One scandal can undo everything we've built." He leaned back, exhausted. "I'm not asking you to stop caring about Lucas. I'm asking you to think beyond yourself. To consider consequences."

"I've been thinking about nothing but consequences my whole life," I said, edge in my voice. "Every word, every action—it's all consequences."

"That's what it means to be part of this family," Father said firmly. "We don't have the luxury of acting without thinking. We represent something larger than ourselves."

"I never asked to represent anything," I shot back. "I never asked to be the mayor's perfect daughter."

"No," Father agreed. "You didn't. You were born into it. Just like I was born into being Patrick Morrison's son, and I had expectations to live up to. That's life, Kate. We all have roles to play."

"What if I don't want to play this role anymore?" The words came out before I could stop them.

Father's expression hardened slightly. "Then you'll face consequences. That's what I'm trying to explain." He stood up, walked to the window, looked out at Beach Hill and the bay beyond. "I didn't want to do this. Your mother said I should, but I didn't want to. I wanted to appeal to your sense of family loyalty, your understanding of duty."

A chill ran down my spine despite the summer heat. "Do what?"

He turned to face me, expression resolved. Like he'd made a decision he hated but wouldn't unmake.

"I'm giving you a choice, Kate. A clear choice."

I gripped the armrests of my chair.

"You can end this relationship with Lucas Wade. Publicly. Attend the pre-Fourth dance with David Hartwell, be photographed together, show Liberty Beach that this was just a summer mistake and you've come to your senses." Father's voice was level, almost gentle. "Or I will make sure Lucas's family pays for this scandal."

My breath caught. "What?"

"Wade's Garage has been operating for twenty years," Father said calmly. "Building inspectors would find code violations. Most old businesses have them. We don't usually enforce every technicality. But we could."

"You wouldn't." But I knew he would.

"The old pier where you've been meeting—it's condemned property. Dangerous. We should probably have it demolished." Father's eyes never left mine. "I'd hate for Lucas to lose his refuge. Or for his father to lose his livelihood. But if you force my hand, I'll do what I have to do."

I stared at my father and felt something crack inside my chest. He was threatening Lucas's family because of me. Using his power as a weapon against innocent people.

"That's not fair," I whispered.

"No," Father agreed. "It's not. But it's effective." He sat down heavily. "I love you more than anything, Kate. But I've worked too hard to let this fall apart now. I need to win this election. And I need you to help me."

"By pretending to be someone I'm not."

"By being who you are—the mayor's daughter." Father's voice softened. "I'm not asking forever, Kate. Just until August. After the election, if you still feel this way about Lucas, we'll talk again. But right now, I need you to do this. For the family. For the town. For me."

The room felt like it was closing in, crushing me into something small and compliant.

"And if I say no?"

"Then the building inspectors visit Wade's Garage tomorrow," Father said quietly. "The demolition crew gets scheduled for the old pier. And I include the Wade family in my speeches as examples of what happens when people don't follow rules. Tom Wade won't be able to do business in this town when I'm finished."

I felt sick. This was my father—the man who'd taught me to ride a bike, who'd read me bedtime stories. And here he sat, threatening to destroy a family to control me.

"You'd really do that?" I asked. "Hurt innocent people to win an election?"

Father's jaw tightened. "I'd do that to protect my family. Don't make me the villain here, Kate. You chose the one boy in Liberty Beach guaranteed to cause problems."

He wasn't wrong. I had known what Lucas represented—danger, scandal, everything inappropriate.

But it had become more than rebellion. Lucas saw me. The real me. Not the performed version, not the political prop, but Kate Morrison underneath all the polish and pearls. With him, I didn't have to calculate every word. I could just be.

And my father was asking me to give that up. Threatening Lucas's family if I didn't.

"I need your answer, Kate." Father's voice was firm but not unkind. "Will you end this relationship and help me win this election? Or will you force me to take action?"

The grandfather clock ticked. The cicadas sang. The children down the street called out that the game was over, time to go home.

I looked at my father and felt the weight of sixteen years settle onto my shoulders. All those performances, all those smiles—they'd led to this moment.

How could I say yes and live with myself after I'd tasted authenticity?

But how could I say no and watch Lucas's father lose his business? Watch the old pier get torn down? All because of me?

"I—" My voice broke. I swallowed, tried again. "I need to think."

Father nodded slowly. "You have until tomorrow morning. Then I need to know what you've decided." He stood, smoothed his tie, and suddenly he was the mayor again. All business, all strategy, all consequences. "I love you, Kate. Don't forget that. Everything I do, I do for this family."

He left me alone in the living room with the ticking clock and the singing cicadas and the impossible choice between being myself and protecting the boy who'd helped me find that self.

I sat there as the summer evening darkened into night, watching shadows creep across the carpet.

I thought about Lucas at the old pier, probably reading by the fading light, thinking I'd abandoned him. I thought about his father at the garage, not knowing his business was about to become a political weapon. I thought about Tom Wade's honest hands, permanently stained with grease, about to be destroyed because his son cared about the mayor's daughter.

I thought about the old pier itself—weathered wood and seagull cries and waves against pilings. The only place I'd ever felt completely real. Soon to be demolished, erased, like it had never existed.

I thought about my father upstairs, probably reviewing poll numbers, convincing himself he was doing the right thing.

And I thought about myself—Kate Morrison, sixteen years old, who'd spent exactly three weeks being authentic and was now being asked to bury that person. Or at least until August, he'd said. As if I could just switch myself on and off like a radio.

I felt myself disappearing. The real Kate—the girl who laughed at bad jokes and liked science fiction—was fading back into the perfect daughter who always did what was expected. The campaign prop. The political asset.

Because what choice did I really have?

I could protect myself and destroy Lucas's family.

Or I could protect Lucas's family and destroy myself.

Either way, something precious would be lost.

The grandfather clock struck nine. Outside, the children had gone home. The cicadas sang on, oblivious.

I sat in the darkening room and felt the weight of tomorrow morning's answer pressing down on me, knowing I'd already made my choice the moment Father gave me the ultimatum.

No choice at all.
