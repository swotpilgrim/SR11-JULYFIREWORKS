# Chapter 3: Collision Course

The boxes were heavier than they looked.

I hurried down Main Street on the morning of June twenty-second, arms full of Fourth of July supplies—bunting, flags, three paint cans, poster board threatening to slide from under my chin. The planning committee meeting started in fifteen minutes, and I was already late.

Mother had kept me an extra half hour at breakfast, reviewing proper behavior for tomorrow's garden party. Which fork to use. How to compliment Mrs. Henderson's roses. The acceptable topics for a young lady. By the time she'd finished, I'd had to race to Miller's General Store for supplies.

Now I was practically running in my sensible white flats, trying not to trip.

"Excuse me," I called to Mrs. Patterson. "Sorry! Planning committee business!"

The morning sun beat down warm. Summer had arrived in earnest—flags flying from storefronts, children playing hopscotch, fresh bread smell from McCarthy's Bakery. In two weeks, tourists would pack Liberty Beach for the Fourth of July celebration.

The celebration I was supposed to be organizing.

The celebration I was currently late for.

I mentally reviewed my checklist as I walked. Parade route finalized? Check. Fireworks vendor confirmed? Check. Stage setup scheduled? Check. Volunteer assignments—

The top can of paint started to slide.

I tried to catch it, shifting the boxes in my arms, which only made the poster board slip. I grabbed for that, which loosened my grip on the bunting. Everything started falling at once, and I couldn't—

I rounded the corner by the docks too fast and crashed into something solid.

Someone solid.

The impact sent my carefully balanced load exploding in every direction. Paint cans hit the sidewalk with metallic clangs and rolled toward the gutter. Poster board scattered like oversized playing cards. The bunting unfurled in a spectacular cascade of red, white, and blue fabric that wrapped around my legs and the stranger's ankles. American flags flew through the air like tiny patriotic missiles.

"Whoa!" The someone I'd crashed into grabbed my arm, steadying me before I followed my supplies onto the pavement. "You okay?"

I looked up, flustered and embarrassed, an apology already forming on my lips.

And found myself staring into the darkest eyes I'd ever seen.

The boy who'd caught me stood about six inches taller than me, wearing rolled blue jeans and a white t-shirt under a leather jacket despite the summer heat. His black hair was slicked back in the style I'd seen on James Dean posters, and he had the kind of face that would make mothers pull their daughters closer—sharp cheekbones, strong jaw, a small scar cutting through his left eyebrow.

Lucas Wade.

I knew him by reputation, of course. Everyone in Liberty Beach knew Lucas Wade. He was the troublemaker, the rebel, the boy teachers whispered about in concerned tones. I'd heard stories—fights behind the school gym, a motorcycle he'd rebuilt from scrap parts, suspensions for talking back to Principal Henderson. My father used "those Wade boys" in his campaign speeches as examples of youth who needed stronger guidance.

But Father had never mentioned that Lucas Wade had a smile like that.

"I'm so sorry," I stammered, pulling free from his steadying grip and immediately crouching to gather scattered supplies. Heat flooded my cheeks. "I wasn't watching where I was going. I'm late for a meeting and—"

"Hey, no damage done." Lucas crouched beside me, picking up a runaway flag before it rolled into a storm drain. "Except maybe to national pride. This little guy almost became a sewer casualty."

He said it so deadpan that I laughed before I could stop myself.

The sound surprised us both.

Lucas looked at me with raised eyebrows, a hint of amusement in his dark eyes. "Did the mayor's daughter just laugh? I thought you only did that at approved intervals during campaign events."

I should have been offended. Instead, I laughed again.

"Sorry," he said, though he didn't sound particularly sorry. "That was rude. Here—" He started gathering bunting, untangling it from our feet with surprising care. "You got attacked by patriotic decorations. That's got to be embarrassing."

"Humiliating, actually." I reached for a paint can, checking to make sure the lid hadn't popped off. "But accurate. I'm organizing the Fourth of July celebration, and apparently the celebration is fighting back."

"Organizing the whole thing?" Lucas handed me a stack of poster board he'd collected. "That's a lot of responsibility."

There was something in his tone—not quite mockery, but not quite sincerity either. Like he was testing whether I'd be offended or honest.

"My father asked me to chair the planning committee," I said, defaulting to my practiced response. Then, surprising myself, I added: "By which I mean he told me I was chairing it. For the campaign."

Lucas's expression shifted slightly. "Everything's for the campaign, right?"

"Pretty much." I sat back on my heels, looking at the scattered supplies still littering the sidewalk. "I had this all perfectly organized five minutes ago. Now it looks like America threw up on Main Street."

Lucas actually grinned at that. "Best description of patriotic decorations I've ever heard." He stood, extending a hand to help me up. "Come on. Let's get your rebellion under control before the paint cans make a break for the harbor."

I took his hand—his palm was warm and calloused, nothing like David's smooth, manicured grip—and let him pull me to my feet.

We worked together for the next few minutes, gathering supplies in companionable silence. Lucas retrieved the last paint can from where it had rolled under a parked truck. I folded the bunting into something resembling neatness. He stacked the poster board while I collected flags.

It was oddly... easy. Natural. Like we'd done this before, though we'd never actually spoken until thirty seconds ago.

"So," Lucas said, examining a particularly large flag with theatrical seriousness. "Scale of one to ten, how bad would it be if you showed up to your meeting covered in red, white, and blue like a walking decoration?"

I looked down at myself. Somehow I'd managed to get bunting fabric draped over my shoulder, red paint smudged on my white blouse, and what appeared to be a star-shaped sticker stuck to my skirt.

"Twelve," I said. "Definitely a twelve."

"Thought so." Lucas peeled the sticker off my skirt with careful fingers, and I tried not to notice how close he was standing. "Your mom would probably have opinions about the mayor's daughter looking like she lost a fight with a float."

"So many opinions." The words came out before I could filter them. "She has opinions about everything. How I dress, how I talk, who I'm seen with, what I order at restaurants, whether I'm smiling enough but not too much—"

I stopped abruptly, horrified. I didn't say things like that. Especially not to strangers. Especially not to Lucas Wade, of all people.

But Lucas wasn't looking at me like I'd said something shocking. He was nodding, something that might have been understanding in his expression.

"Sounds exhausting," he said simply.

Two words. That's all it took.

Something in my chest loosened, just a little.

"It is," I admitted quietly. "Exhausting."

We stood there on the corner by the docks, surrounded by scattered Fourth of July supplies, and for maybe thirty seconds the whole world felt different. Like I was talking to another person instead of performing for an audience. Like honesty was possible.

Like I could breathe.

"Being the mayor's perfect daughter must be a full-time job," Lucas said, handing me the last pile of flags. "No room for mistakes. No room for just being Kate Morrison instead of Katherine Morrison, campaign asset."

I stared at him. "How did you—"

"Know that?" He shrugged. "Small town. Everyone knows everyone's business. Plus, I've seen you at campaign events. You've got a smile that doesn't reach your eyes." He paused. "Except right now. Right now you're actually smiling."

I touched my face self-consciously, suddenly aware that my practiced political smile had vanished and something genuine had taken its place.

"I should go," I said, though I didn't want to. "The meeting—"

"Right. Can't be late for the planning committee." Lucas stepped back, giving me space. But his dark eyes held mine for a moment longer. "For what it's worth? America throwing up on Main Street is a way better look than that perfect daughter thing you usually wear."

I should have been offended. Should have drawn myself up and delivered the kind of cold response my mother would approve of.

Instead, I laughed for the third time in as many minutes.

"Thanks," I said. "I think."

"Anytime." Lucas turned to go, then glanced back. "And Kate? If the decorations attack again, I'll be at my dad's garage most afternoons. I'm pretty good at rescuing people from patriotic ambushes."

Then he walked away, hands in his pockets, leather jacket catching the sunlight, leaving me standing alone with my supplies and a strange, unsettled feeling in my chest.

I'd just had an actual conversation with Lucas Wade.

And I'd laughed. Really laughed.

And for those few minutes, I hadn't been the mayor's daughter or the perfect political prop. I'd just been... me.

Whoever that was.

I gathered my supplies—more carefully this time—and hurried toward the community center where the planning committee waited. But my mind wasn't on parade routes or fireworks permits anymore.

It was on dark eyes and an unexpected smile. On calloused hands and honest words. On the way Lucas had seen right through my performance to something real underneath.

It was dangerous, probably. Lucas Wade was everything I was supposed to avoid—working class, rebellious, politically toxic to my father's campaign.

But he'd made me laugh.

And right now, standing in the June sunshine with America's colors still clinging to my clothes, that felt like the most important thing in the world.

Even if it shouldn't.

Even if I knew better.

Even if this moment of honesty would have to be buried again beneath layers of perfect behavior and political smiles.

For thirty seconds on a sidewalk corner, I'd been real.

And I couldn't remember the last time that had happened.

I walked toward the community center, already five minutes later than before, trying to smooth my hair and straighten my clothes. Trying to put my political mask back in place.

But something had shifted.

And I had a feeling that thirty seconds with Lucas Wade was going to cause more trouble than all the scattered Fourth of July decorations in Liberty Beach.

The thought should have terrified me.

Instead, I couldn't stop smiling.
