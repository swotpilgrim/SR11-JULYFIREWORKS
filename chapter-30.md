# Chapter 30: Fireworks

Two weeks later.

Lucas and I sat on the old pier watching the sun set over Liberty Beach. The wood creaked beneath us, weathered and familiar. Seagulls called overhead, diving for fish in the bay's calm waters.

It was the first time we'd been here since the Fourth of July. Somehow, we'd both needed these two weeks to process everything that had happened, everything that had changed.

"Your father still hasn't had it demolished," Lucas observed, gesturing at the condemned structure we sat on.

"I think he forgot about it," I said. "Too busy managing his campaign recovery."

"How's that going?"

"Better than expected, actually." I leaned back on my hands. "Mr. Henderson's spin worked. The whole 'family navigating normal challenges with grace' narrative seems to have humanized Father. Some voters actually like him more now."

Lucas laughed. "Of course they do. You make a grand romantic gesture, and your father gets credit for being understanding."

"Politics," I said with a shrug. "Everything's a story to manage."

"Are you managing?" Lucas asked more seriously. "These past two weeks—I know they haven't been easy."

He was right. The gossip had been intense. Mrs. Miller had talked about nothing else for days. I'd faced curious stares at the general store, pointed whispers at church, endless questions from classmates about what really happened.

Jen had been supportive but confused. David had been awkward but polite. My parents had been... trying.

Thursday family dinners with Lucas had become a weekly test of everyone's patience. The first one had been excruciating—Mother interrogating Lucas like a hostile witness, Father maintaining chilly politeness, me trying to keep peace. But the second dinner had been slightly better. And last night's third dinner had actually included moments of almost-normal conversation.

Progress, measured in increments.

"I'm managing," I said honestly. "It's different. Sometimes harder than I expected. But also better. Because it's real."

Lucas took my hand, thumb tracing circles on my palm. "I still can't believe you chose this. Chose me. Chose yourself."

"Best choice I ever made," I said. Then reconsidered. "Actually, choosing myself was the best choice. Choosing you was just the smartest implementation of that choice."

"Romantic," Lucas said dryly.

I grinned. "I'm new at this authenticity thing. Give me time."

The sun touched the horizon, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and pinks. The bay reflected the colors, turning the water into liquid fire.

"Your father still doesn't like me," Lucas said.

"No," I admitted. "But he's trying to respect my choice. That's something."

"Your mother likes me even less."

"Also true. But she invited you to dinner again Thursday, so she's definitely trying."

"Trying to find reasons to disapprove," Lucas muttered.

"Trying to know you," I corrected gently. "It's not approval, but it's not forbidding me from seeing you either. That's progress."

Lucas was quiet for a moment. Then: "Kate, I need you to know something. This isn't temporary for me. I'm not dating the mayor's daughter for status or rebellion or teenage kicks. I'm dating you because you're brave and honest and the only person in Liberty Beach who sees through everyone's performances—including your own."

My heart did something complicated in my chest. "Lucas—"

"I know we're sixteen," he continued. "I know we're young. I know this is probably crazy to say after two weeks of official dating—"

"Three weeks if you count before the Fourth," I interrupted.

"—but I need you to know I'm serious about this. About you. About us."

"I know," I said softly. "I'm serious too. I don't know if we'll last forever. We're sixteen, like you said. But right now, this moment, this relationship—it's the realest thing in my life."

"Mine too," Lucas said.

We sat in comfortable silence, watching the sun sink lower.

"I'm applying to technical school," Lucas said suddenly. "For motorcycle design and custom fabrication. There's a program in Richmond that starts next fall."

"That's wonderful!" I turned to face him fully. "Lucas, that's your dream!"

"It was. Then I convinced myself it was unrealistic. That people like me don't get to follow dreams." He smiled at me. "But you followed yours. Chose authenticity over safety. Made me think maybe I could do the same."

"You absolutely can," I said fiercely. "You're talented. Smart. Creative. You deserve to pursue what you love."

"Your father will probably be relieved when I leave for Richmond," Lucas said. "Gets the troublemaker away from his daughter."

"Or he'll be impressed that you're pursuing education and career goals," I countered. "Give him credit. He's trying to evolve."

"Slowly," Lucas qualified.

"Very slowly," I agreed. "But still trying."

The sun disappeared below the horizon. The sky transitioned from orange to purple to deep blue. Stars began to appear, one by one, until the sky glittered.

Real stars, not manufactured fireworks. Natural beauty instead of carefully planned performance.

"What about you?" Lucas asked. "College plans, future dreams—what does Kate Morrison want?"

I considered the question seriously. For sixteen years, someone else had answered that question for me. Now I had to answer it myself.

"I want to go to college," I said slowly. "But I want to choose my major based on what interests me, not what looks good on political applications. Maybe journalism—writing the truth instead of managing narratives. Or social work—actually helping people instead of just organizing events for show."

"The mayor's daughter as a journalist exposing political spin," Lucas said with amusement. "Your father will love that."

"He'll survive," I said. "He's learning that I'm not an extension of his career. I'm my own person."

"A person who exposed his political maneuvering by walking away from his speech on live television," Lucas added.

"Technically it wasn't televised," I corrected. "Just witnessed by the entire town."

"Practically the same thing in Liberty Beach."

I laughed. "True."

We sat together as full darkness fell. The bay lapped against the pier pilings. Somewhere in town, jukebox music drifted from McCarthy's Diner. Life in Liberty Beach continuing its normal rhythms, scandal or no scandal.

"You know what I realized?" I said. "That night, walking away from the stage—I wasn't choosing you over my father. I was choosing myself over performance. You were part of that choice, but you weren't the whole choice. Does that make sense?"

"Perfect sense," Lucas said. "And honestly, it's better that way. If you'd just chosen me because you were in love, you might regret it later. But choosing yourself—that's something you'll never regret."

"Wise words from the town troublemaker," I teased.

"Former troublemaker," Lucas corrected. "Now I'm the town success story. Poor boy who inspired the mayor's daughter to find herself, now pursuing technical education and a career. Mr. Henderson might use me in campaign literature."

I laughed so hard I nearly fell off the pier.

When I caught my breath, Lucas pulled me closer. "Kate Morrison, you changed my life."

"You changed mine," I countered.

"We changed each other's," he said. "That's how it's supposed to work."

He kissed me—soft, sweet, unhurried. Not a stolen kiss or a secret moment. Just two people who'd chosen each other, consequences and all.

When we broke apart, I rested my head on his shoulder and looked up at the stars.

"Think the town will ever stop gossiping about us?" I asked.

"Eventually. Mrs. Miller will find new scandal to obsess over." Lucas paused. "Though we'll probably always be the story of the summer of '57. The mayor's perfect daughter who walked away from her cue."

"I can live with that," I said. "It's better than being the mayor's perfect daughter who never questioned anything."

"Much better," Lucas agreed.

We sat together on the old pier as night deepened around us. Tomorrow I'd go home to my complicated relationship with my parents. Tomorrow Lucas would face another awkward family dinner at the Morrison house. Tomorrow we'd both deal with town gossip and social judgment and all the messy reality of choosing authenticity.

But tonight, we were just Kate and Lucas. No performances, no expectations, no roles to play. Just two people who'd found each other at the old pier and decided that being real was worth any cost.

Above us, stars glittered in infinite patterns. Natural beauty that had existed long before Liberty Beach and would exist long after. Constant, true, authentic.

I'd spent sixteen years being a firework—spectacular, carefully timed, designed to dazzle. Exploding brilliantly then disappearing into smoke.

But I was learning to be a star instead. Burning steadily, constantly, authentically. Less dramatic perhaps, but infinitely more real.

The transformation wasn't complete. I still had moments of falling back into performance, of calculating appearances, of worrying about judgment. Old habits died hard.

But I was trying. Every day, I chose authenticity a little more. Chose honesty over image. Chose myself over expectations.

And Lucas—Lucas who'd shown me what being real looked like—sat beside me, solid and certain and wonderfully, beautifully authentic.

"Ready to head back?" he asked eventually.

"Not really," I admitted. "But we probably should. My ten-thirty curfew and all."

"Can't have the mayor's daughter breaking rules," Lucas said with mock solemnity.

"Some rules," I corrected. "I'm allowed to break some rules now. Just not all of them."

"Progress," Lucas said.

"Progress," I agreed.

We stood, brushing off our jeans, preparing to leave the old pier and return to Liberty Beach proper. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new judgments, new complications.

But we'd face them together. Authentically. Honestly. Really.

Lucas took my hand. "Kate Morrison, thank you."

"For what?"

"For being brave enough to choose yourself. It gave me permission to choose myself too."

I squeezed his hand. "Thank you for seeing me when I was invisible."

"You were never invisible," Lucas said. "Just hidden. There's a difference."

We walked back toward town, toward our families, toward our complicated, messy, beautifully real lives.

Above us, the stars watched. Below us, the bay rolled endlessly to shore.

And between them, Kate Morrison walked hand-in-hand with Lucas Wade, no longer the mayor's perfect daughter but something infinitely better:

Just Kate.

Finally, blessedly, authentically herself.

And that, she'd discovered, was enough.

More than enough.

It was everything.
