# Chapter 5: Crossing Social Lines

"Katherine!"

My mother's voice cut through the afternoon air—sharp, precise, perfectly controlled.

I turned to see her approaching from across the street, every inch the mayor's wife in her tailored cream suit and pearls. Her heels clicked with metronomic precision. Her expression was pleasant, but I knew that look. Behind the smile, she was furious.

"Mother," I said, straightening automatically. "I was just—"

"I can see what you were doing." Her eyes flicked to Lucas, then back. "I was on my way to the planning committee when Mrs. Patterson mentioned seeing you here."

Of course. In Liberty Beach, information traveled faster than lightning.

Mother reached us, and her smile never wavered as she turned to Lucas. "Thank you so much for helping my daughter with her... accident. That was very kind of you."

The words were polite. The tone was dismissal wrapped in silk.

Lucas stood there, hands still in his pockets, expression carefully neutral. "No problem, Mrs. Morrison. Anyone would have helped."

"I'm sure." Mother's smile stayed fixed. "Katherine, dear, you're already quite late for your meeting. We should go."

She didn't wait for my response, just placed a hand on my elbow—gentle but firm—and began steering me away.

I glanced back at Lucas. He was watching us with an expression I couldn't quite read. Not angry, just... resigned. Like he'd expected exactly this.

"Mother, wait—" I started.

"Not now, Katherine." Her voice was low, pleasant, deadly. "Smile and walk."

So I did. Because that's what I always did.

We'd made it maybe twenty feet when I heard another familiar voice.

"Eleanor! And Katherine!"

My father appeared from the direction of the docks, clearly on his way to one of his impromptu meet-the-voters photo opportunities. He had that campaign smile plastered on—warm, approachable, leadership personified. Campaign volunteers trailed behind him with clipboards and cameras.

Then he saw Lucas.

The smile didn't disappear—my father was too skilled a politician for that—but something hardened in his eyes.

"Mr. Wade," Father said, his voice carrying that particular tone he used when he wanted to sound gracious while actually delivering an insult. "Skipping work this afternoon?"

Lucas's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "Lunch break, Mayor Morrison. I work at my dad's garage most days."

"Ah yes. Wade's Garage." Father's smile never wavered. "Hard work, that. Physical labor. Honest, if limited." He paused, and I knew what was coming. I'd heard variations of this speech at campaign events. "Of course, young men who apply themselves could aspire to more. Education, ambition, contributing to the community in meaningful ways."

"Dad works sixteen-hour days keeping people's cars running," Lucas said quietly. "Seems pretty meaningful to people who need transportation."

"Of course, of course." Father waved a hand dismissively. "I meant no disrespect to your father's trade. I simply meant that young men with potential—" his eyes swept over Lucas's leather jacket, rolled jeans, slicked-back hair, "—shouldn't waste it."

The implication hung in the air like smoke. Young men like you are wasting your potential. Young men like you are the problem.

I opened my mouth. To say what, I wasn't entirely sure. To defend Lucas maybe. To point out that Father didn't know anything about him. To mention that Lucas read Camus and thought about alienation and authenticity.

But the words stuck in my throat.

Years of training rose up like a wall. Don't contradict Father in public. Don't cause scenes. Don't make waves. Don't damage the campaign. Be the perfect daughter. Smile. Agree. Support.

The silence stretched for maybe three seconds.

It felt like hours.

"Katherine was just heading to her planning committee meeting," Mother said smoothly, filling the silence. "She's already quite late."

"Of course." Father turned his full attention to me, and his expression softened into genuine warmth. "Katie-girl, before you go—I've been talking to the Rotary Club about featuring you in their Fourth of July program. They want the committee chair to say a few words about community service and civic responsibility. Would you be comfortable with that?"

He was asking, but we both knew it wasn't really a question.

"Of course, Father," I heard myself say. "I'd be honored."

"That's my girl." He patted my shoulder. "You're doing wonderful work with this celebration. Making the family proud."

Then he turned back to Lucas, dismissing him with a look. "Mr. Wade. I'm sure your father needs you back at the garage. Lots of cars to fix, I imagine."

"Yes, sir." Lucas's voice was flat, all emotion carefully scraped away. "You have a good day, Mayor Morrison. Mrs. Morrison." His eyes met mine for just a second. "Kate."

Then he turned and walked away, back toward the docks and Wade's Garage, hands in his pockets, shoulders set.

I watched him go, my throat tight, supplies clutched against my chest like armor.

I hadn't said a word in his defense.

Not one word.

"Katherine." Mother's hand was on my elbow again. "The meeting."

"Right. Yes. Sorry."

As we walked toward the community center, Father fell into step beside us, already back in campaign mode, discussing voter outreach strategies with his volunteers. Mother made appropriate noises of support. I carried my bunting and paint cans and shame.

"That was awkward," Mother said quietly, for my ears only. "What were you thinking, Katherine? Talking to Lucas Wade on Main Street where anyone could see?"

"I ran into him. Literally. My supplies went everywhere. He was just helping—"

"I don't care if he was performing open-heart surgery." Mother's pleasant tone never changed, but her words were steel. "You cannot be seen associating with that boy. Do you understand?"

"He's not what everyone thinks—"

"It doesn't matter what he actually is." Mother stopped walking, forcing me to stop too. Her eyes bored into mine. "Katherine, your father is in a tight race. Robert Caldwell is using every opportunity to paint us as out of touch with Liberty Beach's working families. The absolute last thing we need is for people to see you with Lucas Wade and start speculating."

"Speculating about what? He helped me pick up supplies."

"You know exactly what." Mother's voice dropped even lower. "People gossip, Katherine. They see the mayor's daughter talking to the town troublemaker, and they talk. They question your judgment. Which means they question your father's judgment. Which means they question whether he should be leading this town."

"That's not fair."

"No, it's not. But it's politics." Mother's expression softened slightly. "Darling, I know Lucas helped you today. That was kind of him. But there are lines we cannot cross. Not during a campaign. Not ever. Do you understand?"

I wanted to argue. Wanted to point out that Lucas was intelligent and thoughtful and saw me as an actual person instead of a political prop. Wanted to say that maybe the lines themselves were the problem.

But I was sixteen, standing on Main Street with Fourth of July supplies and my mother's expectations weighing heavier than the paint cans.

"I understand," I whispered.

"Good." Mother resumed walking. "Now, let's get you to that meeting. And Katherine? Fix your hair. You've got bunting fabric in it."

The planning committee meeting was exactly as awful as I'd feared.

Twenty-five minutes late. Mrs. Henderson annoyed. Mr. Thompson had reassigned three of my tasks. Jen kept shooting me concerned looks.

I apologized, explained about the collision (leaving out who I'd collided with), and dove into parade logistics with forced enthusiasm.

My mind was elsewhere.

It was on the docks, where Lucas was probably back at his father's garage, working on engines with grease under his fingernails, proving my family right about him being just a mechanic with wasted potential.

It was on the resigned look in his eyes when Mother dismissed him.

It was on my father's casual cruelty, delivered with a campaign smile.

It was on my own silence.

I'd opened my mouth to defend him. For one brief second, I'd actually been ready to speak up, to tell my father he was wrong, to point out that intelligence and worth weren't determined by social class.

And then I'd closed my mouth and said nothing.

Just like Lucas had expected.

"Kate?" Jen's voice pulled me back to the meeting. "Did you hear Mrs. Henderson's question about the fireworks timing?"

"Sorry. Yes. The fireworks." I flipped through my notes, finding the right information, giving the right answer, being the perfect committee chair.

Being the perfect daughter who didn't make waves.

Being exactly what everyone expected.

The meeting dragged on. Parade permits. Vendor contracts. Stage setup schedules. Red, white, and blue bunting in that order. No sagging.

Everything in its proper place.

Everyone in their proper role.

Including me.

When the meeting finally ended, Jen caught my arm as everyone else filed out.

"Okay, what happened?" she asked. "You were totally distracted the entire time, and you've got this look like someone kicked your puppy."

"Nothing happened. I was just late, and Mrs. Henderson was annoyed—"

"Kate." Jen's eyes were serious. "It's me. What really happened?"

I looked at my best friend, and the urge to tell her everything welled up. About Lucas helping me. About our conversation about Camus and authenticity. About how he saw through my performance and invited me to talk to him again. About my parents' response and my own cowardly silence.

But the words wouldn't come.

Because telling Jen meant making it real. Meant admitting that I cared what Lucas thought. Meant acknowledging that I wanted to go to Wade's Garage and talk about books and be seen as myself instead of as the mayor's daughter.

And I couldn't do that. Couldn't cross that line.

Even in my own head, I was still being careful.

"Just a long day," I said finally. "I'm tired."

Jen studied my face, clearly not believing me but knowing when to back off. "Okay. But if you need to talk, you know I'm here, right?"

"I know. Thanks, Jen."

She squeezed my hand and left.

I stood alone in the community center meeting room, surrounded by Fourth of July planning documents and my own complicated feelings.

Through the window, I could see the docks in the distance. Somewhere down there was Wade's Garage, where Lucas had invited me to talk about books and authenticity.

Where I would never go.

Because I was the mayor's daughter, and we had lines we couldn't cross.

Even when crossing them might be the only honest thing I'd ever done.

I gathered my supplies and my carefully maintained composure and headed home, where I would smile through dinner and agree with my parents and be perfect.

And try not to think about dark eyes and resigned expressions.

And the fact that Lucas had been right about people like me all along.
