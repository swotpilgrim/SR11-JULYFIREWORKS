# Chapter 20: Noble Sacrifice

The Fourth of July planning committee had just adjourned when I saw him.

Lucas, standing at the edge of Town Square, hands in his pockets, watching me with an expression I couldn't quite read. Not angry. Not accusing. Just... resigned.

My heart lurched. I hadn't seen him since before Father's ultimatum, since before everything fell apart. Since before I'd become the girl in the pink dress smiling for newspaper cameras.

I handed my clipboard to Mrs. Henderson with some excuse about needing fresh air and walked toward Lucas before I could lose my nerve. Other committee members watched—I could feel their eyes following me across the square—but I didn't care. Not right now.

"Hi," I said when I reached him. The word felt inadequate for everything unsaid between us.

"Hi." Lucas glanced past me at the committee members pretending not to stare. "Can we talk? Somewhere less public?"

I nodded and fell into step beside him. We walked toward the docks in silence, the same route we'd walked dozens of times when everything was simpler. When being with Lucas was about discovery and authenticity instead of ultimatums and consequences.

The morning sun glinted off the water. Fishing boats bobbed at their moorings. Everything looked exactly the same as it had three weeks ago, but nothing was.

"I saw the paper this morning," Lucas said finally. We'd reached the docks now, away from the committee members and campaign volunteers and town gossips. "You and David Hartwell at the dance. You looked happy."

I started to explain—about Father's threats, about the building inspectors, about the impossible choice—but Lucas held up his hand.

"Let me say this first. Please." He took a breath. "I've been thinking a lot the past couple days. About us, about this summer, about... everything."

Something in his tone made my chest tighten. This felt like goodbye.

"Kate, you need to do what your father asks. Attend events with David, play the perfect daughter, protect your family." Lucas's voice was steady but his eyes betrayed him. "I was stupid, thinking this could work. We're from different worlds. I knew that from the beginning."

"Lucas—"

"Our summer friendship was nice," he continued, as if reading from a script he'd memorized. "But it's time to face reality. You have your life—college, your future, all the opportunities being the mayor's daughter provides. And I have mine. They don't line up."

"That's not true," I protested. "We can figure this out. If we just—"

"We can't." Lucas's jaw tightened. "Your father made that clear. And honestly? He's not wrong. What do I have to offer you except scandal and trouble? David Hartwell can give you a normal life. A good life. The life you're supposed to have."

Each word felt like a slap. "You think I care about that? You think I want the life I'm supposed to have?"

"I think you should," Lucas said quietly. "Because fighting it will only hurt people. Your father's campaign. Your mother's reputation. Your future." He paused. "My father's business."

I froze. "What?"

"Building inspectors came to Wade's Garage yesterday," Lucas said flatly. "After twenty years of operation, suddenly we're not up to code. Five thousand dollars in required repairs or we shut down. Funny timing, don't you think?"

The blood drained from my face. Father had actually done it. He'd threatened to hurt Lucas's family, and he'd followed through.

"Lucas, I didn't know—"

"I know you didn't." His expression softened slightly. "This isn't your fault, Kate. It's mine. I should have stayed away from you. Should have known better than to think the mayor's daughter could be with someone like me without consequences."

"Don't say that." My voice broke. "Don't act like you're not good enough. You're the only person in this town who sees me as Kate instead of a political asset. You're—"

"Not worth destroying your family over." Lucas cut me off gently but firmly. "Kate, listen to me. Your father will make my dad's life impossible if we don't stop this. The building inspectors are just the beginning. He has power, and he'll use it. Against my family, against me, against anyone who gets in his way."

Tears burned behind my eyes. "So you're just giving up? Releasing me like some kind of noble sacrifice?"

"I'm being realistic." Lucas looked out at the water, not meeting my eyes. "You belong in that world up on Beach Hill. I belong down here at the docks. That's just how it is."

"That's how everyone else says it is," I argued. "It doesn't have to be how we say it is."

"Yes, it does." Now Lucas did look at me, and the sadness in his eyes nearly broke me. "Because I won't let my selfishness destroy my father's livelihood. And you shouldn't let yours destroy your family. We both have responsibilities, Kate. People who depend on us."

He was right. I knew he was right. But knowing it didn't make the truth hurt any less.

"I have to go to the dance tonight," I whispered. "I have to stand with David and smile for more photographs and pretend everything's fine."

"I know."

"And on the Fourth, I have to stand onstage with my father and be proof of family values and campaign redemption."

"I know that too."

"I hate it," I said fiercely. "I hate all of it. The performing, the pretending, the endless calculating about appearances and consequences. With you, I didn't have to do any of that. I could just be Kate."

Lucas's composure cracked slightly. "I know. With you, I didn't have to be the troublemaker everyone expects. I could just be Lucas." He swallowed hard. "But maybe that was the fantasy. Maybe those versions of us only existed in the space we created together. And that space is closing."

"It doesn't have to close," I said desperately, even though I could feel it happening—the walls rebuilding, the divide widening, reality crushing the brief beautiful thing we'd found.

"It already has." Lucas reached out like he might touch my face, then dropped his hand. "Your father won, Kate. The campaign, the town, society—they all won. And we lost. That's just how it goes sometimes."

I wanted to argue. Wanted to fight. Wanted to tell him we could run away to some place where nobody knew us, where we could be Lucas and Kate without qualifications or expectations.

But I was the mayor's daughter. And he was Tom Wade's son. And we both had families who needed us to do the right thing, even if the right thing felt completely wrong.

"I should go," Lucas said. "You have a dance tonight. I should... I should not be here when you leave." He started to turn away.

"Lucas, wait." I grabbed his arm. "Just tell me one thing. Please."

He stopped but didn't turn around.

"Was any of it real?" My voice was barely above a whisper. "Or was I just a summer distraction? Teenage rebellion against your reputation?"

Lucas turned then, and the look in his eyes answered before he spoke. "It was the realest thing in my life. That's why I have to end it—before it destroys everything real for both of us."

He walked away before I could respond. I watched him disappear around the corner toward the garage, toward his world, away from mine.

I stood alone at the docks for a long time, feeling the morning sun warm my skin while everything inside me turned cold. Lucas had released me. Set me free. Done the noble thing.

So why did I feel more trapped than ever?

A car horn honked. I turned to see Mother's sedan pulling up to the curb near Town Square. She'd come to drive me home, supervise my rest before tonight's performance.

I walked back toward the square like a puppet on strings. Mrs. Henderson handed me my clipboard with a knowing look—she'd definitely seen me talking to Lucas. By tonight, everyone would know the mayor's daughter had one last conversation with the Wade boy before cutting him loose for good.

The narrative would write itself: Katherine Morrison, having briefly lost her way, had come to her senses and returned to appropriate behavior. Summer romance over, scandal contained, campaign saved.

Everyone would be satisfied. Father, Mother, the voters, the town gossips. Even Lucas thought this was the right choice—he'd walked away to protect his family and mine.

Everyone was satisfied except the part of me that had learned what it felt like to be authentic. To be seen. To be chosen for who I actually was instead of what I represented.

But maybe that part of me had been the fantasy all along. Maybe the real Kate Morrison was exactly who everyone said she was—the mayor's dutiful daughter, appropriate and sensible, performing perfectly until she forgot what wasn't performance.

Mother waved from the car, impatient.

I climbed in, fastened my seatbelt, and prepared for the evening ahead. The dance, the photographs, the proof that I'd chosen correctly.

"How was your meeting?" Mother asked as we drove toward Beach Hill.

"Fine," I said automatically. "Everything's ready for the Fourth."

"That's my girl. Always so organized." Mother patted my hand. "And tonight will be perfect too. I have a good feeling about it."

Perfect. That word again.

I stared out the window as we climbed Beach Hill, leaving the docks behind. Leaving Lucas behind. Leaving the brief, beautiful version of myself behind.

Going home to be the daughter everyone needed me to be.

The performance of a lifetime, as I'd thought yesterday. And tonight was opening night.

I just had to get through it. Put on the pink dress, smile at David, wave for the cameras. Do it all again tomorrow and the day after until it became automatic again. Until I forgot what Lucas's voice sounded like, what it felt like to laugh without calculating the impression, what freedom tasted like.

Eventually, everyone said, I'd forget. The hurt would fade. This would become a footnote in my perfect life—a brief summer when the mayor's daughter made a mistake but corrected course before any permanent damage was done.

Everyone seemed very confident about that.

I wish I felt the same.

At home, Mother insisted I rest. I lay on my bed fully dressed, staring at the ceiling, counting the hours until I had to become Kate Morrison, Mayor's Daughter, once again.

Lucas's words echoed in my head: "It was the realest thing in my life."

Mine too, I thought. Mine too.

And that's exactly why it hurt so much to let it go.
